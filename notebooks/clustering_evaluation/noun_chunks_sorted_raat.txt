"Campaign models (picture the board game Risk ) present big-picture, low-resolution representations of the simulation world. They represent entire battle formations as single entities, and rarely (if ever) include individual weapon systems. They instead use aggregate performance parameters derived from average performance for analyses in specific context. Campaign-level simulations can run rapidly at an appropriately low resolution, trading precision for speed. Several high-level simulations offer the appropriate resolution to examine campaign-level questions , and their results are well understood and widely accepted . These simulations represent joint conflict at high levels of abstraction, allowing them to quickly illustrate multiple scenario variations. However, as in road trip planning, some parts of the journey require more granular direction. Highly-detailed, mission-level simulations fill this role by offering more of a “street view” that represents interactions between entities at a much higher resolution. They could simulate a scenario as granular as an individual aircraft engaging an array of air defense missile launchers. Some can integrate a human to make critical decisions in real time, rather than modeling command-decision processes in software as in a campaign-level simulation. Ideally, mission- and campaign-level simulations should complement each other. However, given that government-owned, mission-level simulations typically belong to the various services, they only authoritatively model a single part of the joint environment. The U.S. Air Force might be forced to combine high-resolution aircraft models with approximate models of adversary or other service capabilities. This creates a challenge to joint planning. The Pentagon Can Learn From Past Mistakes How can the Defense Department make the most of campaign- and mission-level simulations? Since the military doesn’t have much experience or data from large-scale operations to simulate multi-domain operations, defense professionals should integrate system models from all of the services and the intelligence community into a highly detailed representation of a complete joint environment. Given security concerns, it’s not surprising that live exercise opportunities to explore existing multi-domain operations are limited. However, while using simulations to explore difficult problems is a viable alternative, it is also more easily said than done. Simulation remains America’s best approach to examine future military operations. It not only offers a risk-free venue for testing new concepts, but also enables exploring large-scale defensive or offensive operations with advantages like maintaining secrecy and not provoking adversaries. Three important lessons from past simulation program failures, seemingly obvious in hindsight, could help the military going forward. First, align program responsibility and authority. Program management should not only have the responsibility for success, but also the authority to control funding. An example of what not to do can be instructive. In 1995, the U.S. government’s Joint Simulation System program was designed to construct a training-focused joint simulation capability by combining the authoritative models from each service. However, the program manager responsible for the program’s success had little de facto authority over most of the participants, including the service components nominally under his supervision. Services had their own funding, not controlled by the program manager. Individual service needs often took precedence over program needs, sometimes resulting in unmet program goals. Second, create buy-in among those who participate in the simulation. Another 1990s Department of Defense effort, the Joint Modeling and Analysis System, was intended to create a mission-level simulation capability that would join high-fidelity, service-specific, simulations. The plan required that these service-specific simulations comply with the program’s standards, necessitating rebuilds of the existing simulations and yet further modifications with subsequent changes to the standard. Eventually, frustrated users in the services stopped caring. Most of them already had simulations that sufficed, and they did not see much benefit in the costly replacement. The need to continually revise their models for joint compliance would not, in their view, produce a reasonable return on investment. Blindness to meeting user needs, along with several other management and technical challenges, featured significantly in the JMASS’s eventual demise. Finally, demonstrate flexibility — when it comes to simulations, one size does not fit all. The Joint Warfare System was yet another 1990s effort to produce a department-wide simulation capability. In this case, the monolithic system was intended to simulate a campaign from “ port to foxhole ,” eliminating the need to use separate models to represent processes like logistics and combat. The Joint Warfare System tried to tackle the technical challenge of natively providing multiple levels of resolution, thus allowing the user to choose levels of fidelity. In its ambition, the system was continually over budget and behind schedule — it never produced a useful capability for analysts . Today, campaign-level models are available and widely used around the Defense Department. However, they should be integrated with complementary mission-level simulations. Continuing to use a monolithic resource will be costly. A New Way Forward Designers should strive to create mechanisms to allow different simulations to communicate with each other. Combining simulations this way offers a promising way forward. In operation, it is roughly analogous to a video teleconference: Invitees call and register with a conference center and are allowed online with other registrants. Individuals can participate from anywhere, interact with each other in numerous ways, and end the conference by hanging up. The process is easily repeatable. Establishing a cooperating combination of simulations (often called a federation)","Campaign models picture the board game Risk present big-picture low-resolution representations of the simulation world They represent entire battle formations as single entities and rarely if ever include individual weapon systems They instead use aggregate performance parameters derived from average performance for analyses in specific context Campaign-level simulations can run rapidly at an appropriately low resolution trading precision for speed Several high-level simulations offer the appropriate resolution to examine campaign-level questions , and their results are well understood and widely accepted .

Entfernungsbereich (bis 10 km) eingeführt. Das System erkennt unerlaubte Aktivitäten auch bei schlechten Wetterbedingungen. Mit eingebetteter Analyse und Bildverarbeitung entlastet der Ranger HDC die kognitive Arbeitsbelastung und ermöglicht die sichere Unterscheidung von echten Bedrohungen und Fehlalarmen. Der Ranger HDC MR ist ein elektro-optischer Sensor für die Perimeter-Überwachung im mittleren Entfernungsbereich (Foto: FLIR) Die Leistungsfähigkeit des Wärmebildgeräts wird mit einem eingebauten Nebelfilter zum Durchschauen von Nebel und Dunst sowie durch einen optionalen Merlin ASX-Turbulenzfilter zum Durchschauen von Wärme-/Luftturbulenzen für eine genauere Zielklassifizierung erweitert. Ein optionaler Laser-Entfernungsmesser unterstützt die Geo-Lokalisierung von Zielen und ein schneller und präziser Schwenk-/Neigekopf ermöglicht raschen Szenenwechsel.

"European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) der Europäischen Kommission ist ein Konsortium mit mehreren großen Verteidigungs-, Kommunikations- und Cybersicherheitsunternehmen sowie Mittelständlern aus dem Hochtechnologie-Bereich mit der Entwicklung eines integrierten, modularen, unbemannten Bodensystem (integrated Modular Unmanned Ground System, iMUGS) beauftragt worden. Bei Gesamtkosten von 32,6 Millionen Euro wird der Auftrag mit 30,6 Millionen Euro aus dem EDIDP gefördert. Das Projekt wird von Estland geleitet. Die technischen Anforderungen wurden mit Finnland, Lettland, Deutschland, Belgien, Frankreich und Spanien abgestimmt. Die Länder planen, die restlichen zwei Millionen Euro des Projektbudgets zu finanzieren. Unter Leitung von Milrem Robotics wird eine modulare und skalierbare Architektur für hybride bemannte und unbemannte Systeme entwickelt. Die Architektur soll die Grundlage werden, um ein europaweites Ökosystem für Luft- und Bodenplattformen, Führungs-, Kontroll- und Kommunikationsausrüstung, Sensoren, Nutzlasten und Algorithmen zu standardisieren. Das Prototyp-System wird ein bestehendes unbemanntes Bodenfahrzeug – Themis von Milrem Robotics – und eine spezifische Liste von Nutzlasten nutzen. Das Ergebnis des Projekts wird im Rahmen von Militärübungen der teilnehmenden Mitgliedstaaten oder auf separaten Testgeländen unter Einsatzbedingungen und relevanten klimatischen Bedingungen demonstriert. Während der Projektphase werden operatives Know-how gesammelt und Konzepte für den kombinierten Einsatz bemannter und unbemannter Mittel entwickelt, wobei die auf Robotik, künstliche Intelligenz und autonome Systeme anwendbaren ethischen Aspekte berücksichtigt werden sollen. Auch modernste virtuelle und konstruktive Simulationsumgebungen werden eingerichtet. iMUGS wird eine Kooperation zwischen 14 Parteien sein: Projektkoordinator Milrem Robotics (Estland)","European Defence Industrial Development Programme EDIDP der Europäischen Kommission ist ein Konsortium mit mehreren großen Verteidigungs-, Kommunikations- und Cybersicherheitsunternehmen sowie Mittelständlern aus dem Hochtechnologie-Bereich mit der Entwicklung eines integrierten modularen unbemannten Bodensystem integrated Modular Unmanned Ground System iMUGS beauftragt worden Bei Gesamtkosten von 32,6 Millionen Euro wird der Auftrag mit 30,6 Millionen Euro aus dem EDIDP gefördert Das Projekt wird von Estland geleitet Die technischen Anforderungen wurden mit Finnland Lettland Deutschland Belgien Frankreich und Spanien abgestimmt Die Länder planen die restlichen zwei Millionen Euro des Projektbudgets zu finanzieren Unter Leitung von Milrem Robotics wird eine modulare und skalierbare Architektur für hybride bemannte und unbemannte Systeme entwickelt Die Architektur soll die Grundlage werden um ein europaweites Ökosystem für Luft- und Bodenplattformen Führungs-, Kontroll- und Kommunikationsausrüstung Sensoren Nutzlasten und Algorithmen zu standardisieren Das Prototyp-System wird ein bestehendes unbemanntes Bodenfahrzeug – Themis von Milrem Robotics – und eine spezifische Liste von Nutzlasten nutzen Das Ergebnis des Projekts wird im Rahmen von Militärübungen der teilnehmenden Mitgliedstaaten oder auf separaten Testgeländen unter Einsatzbedingungen und relevanten klimatischen Bedingungen demonstriert Während der Projektphase werden operatives Know-how gesammelt und Konzepte für den kombinierten Einsatz bemannter und unbemannter Mittel entwickelt wobei die auf Robotik künstliche Intelligenz und autonome Systeme anwendbaren ethischen Aspekte berücksichtigt werden sollen Auch modernste virtuelle und konstruktive Simulationsumgebungen werden eingerichtet iMUGS wird eine Kooperation zwischen 14 Parteien sein: Projektkoordinator Milrem Robotics Estland"

General Defence Plan,General Defence Plan
"General Defence Plan (GDP) in der Norddeutschen Tiefebene seit den 1950er Jahren einen engen Austausch praktiziert. Von der Verteidigungsplanung mit Absprachen über gemeinsame Ausbildungen und Übungen, Personalaustausch bis hin zu Rüstungsprojekten wurde vieles gemeinsam unternommen. Dadurch ist über mehr als sechs Jahrzehnte ein Vertrauen gewachsen, das im letzten Jahrzehnt nochmals in verstärkte militärpolitische Aktivitäten mündete. Angehörige der Division Schnelle Kräfte und der Luchtmobile Brigade übten bereits 2011 gemeinsam in der Übung „Zuverlässiges Schwert“ (Foto: Defensiekrant) Auch die Zusammenarbeit mit anderen NATO-Nationen ist intensiv, so wie mit Frankreich im Eurokorps und seit Langem in der Deutsch-Französischen Brigade. Die US-Armee ist und bleibt ein Garant intensiven Zusammenwirkens auf vielen Gebieten. Nur zwei von etlichen Beispielen, die sich in NATO- und EU- militärischen Aktivitäten, wie z.B. Framework Nation Concept und PESCO, fortsetzen. Allerdings ist die Zusammenarbeit des deutschen sowie niederländischen Heeres der letzten Jahre noch von besonderer Qualität. Dieses ist Ausdruck der guten Erfahrungen über sehr lange Zeit, des gewachsenen Vertrauens, der ähnlichen Mentalität in Planung und Durchführung militärischer Aktionen, aber auch von notwendigen politischen Entwicklungen. Durch die erwähnten NATO-/EU-Initiativen sind beide Nationen und ihre Streitkräfte nochmals stärker aufeinander zugegangen. Der äußere innen- und außenpolitische Druck und gegenläufige Entwicklungen seit dem Ende des Ost-West-Konfliktes finden Ausdruck in der Sicherheitspolitik und entsprechender Streitkräfteplanung. Zuerst führte das Einfahren der Friedensdividende zu Einsparungen in den Verteidigungshaushalten und damit verfügbaren Streitkräften und deren Mitteln. Nach einem starken Abbau der Kräfte und Fähigkeiten zwangen einerseits das weltweite sicherheitspolitische Engagement, vor allem aber seit 2014 die erneute Betonung der Bündnis- und Landesverteidigung aufgrund der sicherheitspolitischen Entwicklungen an den Außengrenzen Europas, wieder Fähigkeiten und Mittel zu generieren. Die Lösung besteht in noch engerer Zusammenarbeit und im Zusammenfügen von sich ergänzenden militärischen Komponenten. Nicht jeder hat mehr alles, aber insbesondere stärkere Rahmennationen und kleinere Partner können gemeinsam Synergieeffekte und zusammen bessere Stärke erreichen. Sie befördern die vertiefte Integration innerhalb des europäischen Pfeilers der NATO und in der EU selbst. Die deutsch niederländische Zusammenarbeit der Landstreitkräfte ist dafür ein exzellentes Beispiel. Seit 2014 wird diese Zusammenarbeit im binationalen Projekt „Griffin“ mit unterschiedlichen Teilaufgaben erneut und sehr intensiv fortgeführt. Verfahren Am 4. Februar 2016 unterzeichneten die damalige Ministerinnen Jeanine Hennis und Ursula von der Leyen eine weitere Absichtserklärung für eine engere Zusammenarbeit an Bord der „Karel Doorman“; im Hintergrund ein Leopard 2A6 (2A6 Foto: Defensiekrant)",General Defence Plan GDP in der Norddeutschen Tiefebene seit den 1950er Jahren einen engen Austausch praktiziert Von der Verteidigungsplanung mit Absprachen über gemeinsame Ausbildungen und Übungen Personalaustausch bis hin zu Rüstungsprojekten wurde vieles gemeinsam unternommen Dadurch ist über mehr als sechs Jahrzehnte ein Vertrauen gewachsen das im letzten Jahrzehnt nochmals in verstärkte militärpolitische Aktivitäten mündete Angehörige der Division Schnelle Kräfte und der Luchtmobile Brigade übten bereits 2011 gemeinsam in der Übung „Zuverlässiges Schwert“ Foto: Defensiekrant Auch die Zusammenarbeit mit anderen NATO-Nationen ist intensiv so wie mit Frankreich im Eurokorps und seit Langem in der Deutsch-Französischen Brigade Die US-Armee ist und bleibt ein Garant intensiven Zusammenwirkens auf vielen Gebieten Nur zwei von etlichen Beispielen die sich in NATO- und EU- militärischen Aktivitäten wie z.B Framework Nation Concept und PESCO fortsetzen Allerdings ist die Zusammenarbeit des deutschen sowie niederländischen Heeres der letzten Jahre noch von besonderer Qualität Dieses ist Ausdruck der guten Erfahrungen über sehr lange Zeit des gewachsenen Vertrauens der ähnlichen Mentalität in Planung und Durchführung militärischer Aktionen aber auch von notwendigen politischen Entwicklungen Durch die erwähnten NATO-/EU-Initiativen sind beide Nationen und ihre Streitkräfte nochmals stärker aufeinander zugegangen Der äußere innen- und außenpolitische Druck und gegenläufige Entwicklungen seit dem Ende des Ost-West-Konfliktes finden Ausdruck in der Sicherheitspolitik und entsprechender Streitkräfteplanung Zuerst führte das Einfahren der Friedensdividende zu Einsparungen in den Verteidigungshaushalten und damit verfügbaren Streitkräften und deren Mitteln Nach einem starken Abbau der Kräfte und Fähigkeiten zwangen einerseits das weltweite sicherheitspolitische Engagement vor allem aber seit 2014 die erneute Betonung der Bündnis- und Landesverteidigung aufgrund der sicherheitspolitischen Entwicklungen an den Außengrenzen Europas wieder Fähigkeiten und Mittel zu generieren Die Lösung besteht in noch engerer Zusammenarbeit und im Zusammenfügen von sich ergänzenden militärischen Komponenten Nicht jeder hat mehr alles aber insbesondere stärkere Rahmennationen und kleinere Partner können gemeinsam Synergieeffekte und zusammen bessere Stärke erreichen Sie befördern die vertiefte Integration innerhalb des europäischen Pfeilers der NATO und in der EU selbst Die deutsch niederländische Zusammenarbeit der Landstreitkräfte ist dafür ein exzellentes Beispiel Seit 2014 wird diese Zusammenarbeit im binationalen Projekt „Griffin“ mit unterschiedlichen Teilaufgaben erneut und sehr intensiv fortgeführt Verfahren Am 4 Februar 2016 unterzeichneten die damalige Ministerinnen Jeanine Hennis und Ursula von der Leyen eine weitere Absichtserklärung für eine engere Zusammenarbeit an Bord der „Karel Doorman“; im Hintergrund ein Leopard 2A6 2A6 Foto: Defensiekrant

Julia Computing has been awarded funding by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,Julia Computing has been awarded funding by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
"Julia Computing has been awarded funding by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to accelerate simulation of Analog and Mixed-Signal circuit models using state of the art machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Funding was awarded as part of DARPA’s Intelligent Auto-Generation and Composition of Surrogate Models (Ditto) effort. According to DARPA, “Ditto will explore novel third-wave AI solutions through the lens of microelectronic system simulation. The effort seeks to develop an automated software framework that can take in a microelectronic system design, train effective ML surrogate models of sub-system components, and simulate these designs 1000x faster, while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy. These capabilities should provide a significant boost to the US semiconductor industry and US competitiveness as part of DARPA’s broader Electronics Resurgence Initiative.” “Julia’s performance and differentiable programming capabilities give us a unique advantage in creating novel tools for modeling and simulation,” says project PI and Julia Computing CTO Keno Fischer. “Using newly developed surrogate architectures, such as our Continuous Time Echo State Network (CTESN)","Julia Computing has been awarded funding by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA to accelerate simulation of Analog and Mixed-Signal circuit models using state of the art machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques Funding was awarded as part of DARPA’s Intelligent Auto-Generation and Composition of Surrogate Models Ditto effort According to DARPA “Ditto will explore novel third-wave AI solutions through the lens of microelectronic system simulation The effort seeks to develop an automated software framework that can take in a microelectronic system design train effective ML surrogate models of sub-system components and simulate these designs 1000x faster while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy These capabilities should provide a significant boost to the US semiconductor industry and US competitiveness as part of DARPA’s broader Electronics Resurgence Initiative.” “Julia’s performance and differentiable programming capabilities give us a unique advantage in creating novel tools for modeling and simulation,” says project PI and Julia Computing CTO Keno Fischer “Using newly developed surrogate architectures such as our Continuous Time Echo State Network CTESN"

"Konfliktszenarien (Grafiken: Bundeswehr) Die Truppe muss daher im gesamten Intensitätsspektrum auf den Kampf mit einem militärischen Gegner vorbereitet sein, der mindestens bei ausgewählten Truppenteilen moderne Waffentechnologie in schnellen und teilweise automatisierten Entscheidungszyklen einsetzt, über effektive Aufklärungs- und Wirkungsverbünde verfügt und das Gefecht auf Abstand durch Massierung weitreichender und zum Teil hochpräziser Waffenwirkung in allen Dimensionen zu entscheiden versucht. Das Heer muss vorrangig seine eigenen taktischen Fähigkeiten zur Lage-, Ziel- und Wirkungsaufklärung weiterentwickeln und in einen mit den Aufklärungsergebnissen anderer Streitkräftekomponenten und Ressorts vernetzten Systemverbund integrieren. Die eigenen Entscheidungszyklen müssen soweit beschleunigt werden, dass es gelingt, diejenigen des Gegners zu unterlaufen und ihm gegenüber Wirkungsüberlegenheit zu erzielen. Insgesamt werden die im Rahmen der Landes- und Bündnisverteidigung anzunehmenden Konfliktszenarien wahrscheinlich deutlich intensivierte Aufklärungsoperationen und Anstrengungen des Militärischen Nachrichtenwesens (MilNW) erfordern, die unter hohem Zeitdruck, streitkräftegemeinsam und multinational erbracht werden müssen. Dem MilNW im Heer kommt auf der taktischen Ebene dabei im Wesentlichen die Aufgabe zu, die den eigenen Kräften gegenüberstehenden Fähigkeiten und Bedrohungspotenziale frühzeitig zu erkennen, aus ihrer Präsenz und Dislozierung sowie ihrem Verhalten mögliche Absichten und wahrscheinliche Handlungsoptionen abzuleiten, deren tatsächliches Eintreten auf dem Gefechtsfeld räumlich präzise und mit möglichst großem zeitlichen Vorlauf zu bestimmen. Auch müssen die eigenen Truppenführer proaktiv unterstützt werden durch Bereitstellung zeit- und bedarfsgerechter Daten, Informationen und Erkenntnisse bei der Auswahl ihrer Handlungsalternativen und Ziele mit dem Ziel, Führungsüberlegenheit zu erzeugen. Beschleunigung von Aufklärung und Auswertung Um in nahezu Echtzeit einen Überblick und Verständnis über die Lage zu erhalten und Entscheidungsüberlegenheit auf allen Führungsebenen kontinuierlich zu gewährleisten, gilt es für das MilNW im Heer, die bisherigen Prozesse des Informationsmanagements und des Einsatzes der verfügbaren Aufklärungsmittel und -kräfte zu optimieren und zu beschleunigen. Mit dem Ziel, den Informationsbedarf der Truppenführer auf den jeweiligen Ebenen der taktischen Führung zeitgerecht decken zu können, ist es entscheidend, Strukturen und Verfahren zu etablieren, mit denen die gewonnenen Daten und Informationen schnell und präzise ausgewertet werden können. Diesem Ziel folgend, fordert das Konzept „Joint Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance“ (JISR)","Konfliktszenarien Grafiken: Bundeswehr Die Truppe muss daher im gesamten Intensitätsspektrum auf den Kampf mit einem militärischen Gegner vorbereitet sein der mindestens bei ausgewählten Truppenteilen moderne Waffentechnologie in schnellen und teilweise automatisierten Entscheidungszyklen einsetzt über effektive Aufklärungs- und Wirkungsverbünde verfügt und das Gefecht auf Abstand durch Massierung weitreichender und zum Teil hochpräziser Waffenwirkung in allen Dimensionen zu entscheiden versucht Das Heer muss vorrangig seine eigenen taktischen Fähigkeiten zur Lage-, Ziel- und Wirkungsaufklärung weiterentwickeln und in einen mit den Aufklärungsergebnissen anderer Streitkräftekomponenten und Ressorts vernetzten Systemverbund integrieren Die eigenen Entscheidungszyklen müssen soweit beschleunigt werden dass es gelingt diejenigen des Gegners zu unterlaufen und ihm gegenüber Wirkungsüberlegenheit zu erzielen Insgesamt werden die im Rahmen der Landes- und Bündnisverteidigung anzunehmenden Konfliktszenarien wahrscheinlich deutlich intensivierte Aufklärungsoperationen und Anstrengungen des Militärischen Nachrichtenwesens MilNW erfordern die unter hohem Zeitdruck streitkräftegemeinsam und multinational erbracht werden müssen Dem MilNW im Heer kommt auf der taktischen Ebene dabei im Wesentlichen die Aufgabe zu die den eigenen Kräften gegenüberstehenden Fähigkeiten und Bedrohungspotenziale frühzeitig zu erkennen aus ihrer Präsenz und Dislozierung sowie ihrem Verhalten mögliche Absichten und wahrscheinliche Handlungsoptionen abzuleiten deren tatsächliches Eintreten auf dem Gefechtsfeld räumlich präzise und mit möglichst großem zeitlichen Vorlauf zu bestimmen Auch müssen die eigenen Truppenführer proaktiv unterstützt werden durch Bereitstellung zeit- und bedarfsgerechter Daten Informationen und Erkenntnisse bei der Auswahl ihrer Handlungsalternativen und Ziele mit dem Ziel Führungsüberlegenheit zu erzeugen Beschleunigung von Aufklärung und Auswertung Um in nahezu Echtzeit einen Überblick und Verständnis über die Lage zu erhalten und Entscheidungsüberlegenheit auf allen Führungsebenen kontinuierlich zu gewährleisten gilt es für das MilNW im Heer die bisherigen Prozesse des Informationsmanagements und des Einsatzes der verfügbaren Aufklärungsmittel und -kräfte zu optimieren und zu beschleunigen Mit dem Ziel den Informationsbedarf der Truppenführer auf den jeweiligen Ebenen der taktischen Führung zeitgerecht decken zu können ist es entscheidend Strukturen und Verfahren zu etablieren mit denen die gewonnenen Daten und Informationen schnell und präzise ausgewertet werden können Diesem Ziel folgend fordert das Konzept „Joint Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance“ JISR"

"Low-precision (“quantized”) numerical data types are used and packed to represent simulation states, leading to reduced memory space and bandwidth consumption. Quantized simulation allows higher resolution simulation with less memory, which is especially attractive on GPUs. Implementing a quantized simulator that has high performance and packs the data tightly for aggressive storage reduction would be extremely labor-intensive using traditional programming languages. To make the creation of quantized simulation practical, we have developed a new set of language abstractions and a compilation system. A suite of tailored domain-specific optimizations ensure quantized simulators often run as fast as the full-precision simulators, despite the overhead of encoding-decoding the packed quantized data types. Our programming language and compiler, based on Taichi, allow developers to effortlessly switch between different full-precision and quantized simulators, to explore the full design space of quantization schemes, and ultimately to achieve a good balance between space and precision. The creation of quantized simulation with our system has large benefits in terms of memory consumption and performance. For example, on a single GPU, we can simulate a Game of Life with 20 billion cells (8× compression per pixel), an Eulerian fluid system with 421 million active voxels (1.6× compression per voxel)",Low-precision “quantized” numerical data types are used and packed to represent simulation states leading to reduced memory space and bandwidth consumption Quantized simulation allows higher resolution simulation with less memory which is especially attractive on GPUs Implementing a quantized simulator that has high performance and packs the data tightly for aggressive storage reduction would be extremely labor-intensive using traditional programming languages To make the creation of quantized simulation practical we have developed a new set of language abstractions and a compilation system A suite of tailored domain-specific optimizations ensure quantized simulators often run as fast as the full-precision simulators despite the overhead of encoding-decoding the packed quantized data types Our programming language and compiler based on Taichi allow developers to effortlessly switch between different full-precision and quantized simulators to explore the full design space of quantization schemes and ultimately to achieve a good balance between space and precision The creation of quantized simulation with our system has large benefits in terms of memory consumption and performance For example on a single GPU we can simulate a Game of Life with 20 billion cells 8× compression per pixel an Eulerian fluid system with 421 million active voxels 1.6× compression per voxel

"New research by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) climate scientists and collaborators shows that satellite measurements of the temperature of the troposphere (the lowest region of the atmosphere) may have underestimated global warming over the last 40 years. The research appears in the Journal of Climate . The team studied four different properties of tropical climate change. Each property is a ratio between trends in two “complementary” variables. Complementary variables — like tropical temperature and moisture — are expected to show correlated behavior. This correlated behavior is governed by basic, well-understood physical processes. The first three properties considered by the team involved relationships between tropical temperature and tropical water vapor (WV)",New research by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory LLNL climate scientists and collaborators shows that satellite measurements of the temperature of the troposphere the lowest region of the atmosphere may have underestimated global warming over the last 40 years The research appears in the Journal of Climate .

"Open Data Platform initiative (ODPi). Motivation für die Konsolidierung ist die Nähe zwischen Machine-Learning-Techniken und der Datenverwaltung. Erstere benötigen in den meisten Fällen große Datenmengen unter anderem für das Training neuronaler Netze. Umgekehrt nutzen Data Scientists zunehmend ML-Methoden zur Analyse der Daten. Schulterschluss von Daten und ML In der offiziellen Ankündigung der Foundation heißt es daher ""KI und Daten sind untrennbar miteinander verbunden und voneinander abhängig"". Die Zusammenführung der Projekte unter einen gemeinsamen Schirm ermögliche eine engere Zusammenarbeit, Integration und Interoperabilität zwischen Projekten. Außerdem wolle die Organisation einheitliche Richtlinien für Endanwender hinsichtlich Tools, Standards und der Zukunft von KI, Datenverarbeitung und Analytik geben. Die LF AI & Data Foundation führt die beim Zusammenschluss insgesamt 25 Projekte der beiden ursprünglichen Organisationen gemeinsam weiter. Von der LF AI Foundation fließen unter anderem das Standardformat zum Austausch neuronaler Netze ONNX (Open Neural Network eXchnage), das Toolset Ludwig und die probabilistische Programmiersprache Pyro ein.

"Sicherheitsaufgaben (BOS) Wert auf digitale Souveränität. Als einziger Anbieter für Firewalls mit VS-NfD Zulassung bietet genua vertrauenswürdige IT-Sicherheit aus Deutschland. Herausforderungen der öffentlichen Sicherheit, wie die aktuelle Corona-Pandemie, zeigen, wie wichtig die reibungslose Zusammenarbeit der beteiligten Instanzen auf kommunaler, Bezirks-, Landes- und Bundesebene ist. Das gilt besonders für den Informationsaustausch zwischen Behörden und Einsatzkräften. Doch aufgrund des föderalen Systems in Deutschland existiert in BOS eine große Bandbreite an Organisationsstrukturen mit entsprechend heterogener IT-Ausstattung. Diese ist gekennzeichnet durch eine Vielzahl eigener Entwicklungen und Anwendungen, fehlende Schnittstellen und unterschiedliche Dateiformate. (Foto: genua GmbH) BOS stehen deshalb bei der digitalen Transformation an mehreren Brennpunkten unter Erfolgsdruck: Leistungsfähige Schnittstellen müssen Hürden beim Informationsaustausch beseitigen; zugleich sollen zeitgemäße und zukunftssichere Lösungen für die mobile Datenkommunikation einen stetig steigenden Bedarf decken. Und natürlich ist eine reibungslose Kommunikation nicht das einzige Ziel. Organisationen im öffentlichen Sektor sind laufend von Cyberattacken, Datenspionage oder Sabotage bedroht. Der wirksame Schutz ihrer digitalen Infrastrukturen und Kommunikationsnetze ist deshalb von zentraler Bedeutung. Digitale Souveränität für zukunftsorientierte Behörden Eine zentrale Aufgabe bei der Digitalisierung besteht einerseits darin, effektive und sichere Kommunikationskanäle über alle Ebenen hinweg zu schaffen. Andererseits müssen Anwendungen und Daten so einsatzgerecht kombiniert werden, dass alle Beteiligten die Ressourcen effektiv nutzen können. Interoperabilität sowie die Fähigkeit, Daten bei Wahrung ihrer Vertraulichkeit und Integrität über offene Schnittstellen zu verteilen, sind essenzielle Eckpfeiler digitaler Souveränität. Um reibungsloses staatliches Handeln von BOS auch in Krisensituationen zu gewährleisten, sollten Schlüsseltechnologien wie Kommunikations-, IT- und Sicherheitstechnik grundsätzlich aus vertrauenswürdigen Quellen bezogen werden. Die genua GmbH ist deutscher IT Security Hersteller mit umfassendem Know-how und einem breiten Leistungsangebot. Als Tochterunternehmen der Bundesdruckerei ist genua langjähriger Vertrauenspartner und „Qualifizierter Partner“ des BSI. Systemlösung von genua für VS-NfD-Kommunikation Die VS-NfD-Zulassungen für die Sicherheitslösungen von genua – ob für den mobilen Einsatz oder den sicheren Datenaustausch von VS-NfD-Daten – belegen hohe Qualität und Vertrauenswürdigkeit. Denn als einziger Hersteller bietet genua zur Abschirmung sensibler Daten hochsichere Firewalls, die vom Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)","Sicherheitsaufgaben BOS Wert auf digitale Souveränität Als einziger Anbieter für Firewalls mit VS-NfD Zulassung bietet genua vertrauenswürdige IT-Sicherheit aus Deutschland Herausforderungen der öffentlichen Sicherheit wie die aktuelle Corona-Pandemie zeigen wie wichtig die reibungslose Zusammenarbeit der beteiligten Instanzen auf kommunaler Bezirks-, Landes- und Bundesebene ist Das gilt besonders für den Informationsaustausch zwischen Behörden und Einsatzkräften Doch aufgrund des föderalen Systems in Deutschland existiert in BOS eine große Bandbreite an Organisationsstrukturen mit entsprechend heterogener IT-Ausstattung Diese ist gekennzeichnet durch eine Vielzahl eigener Entwicklungen und Anwendungen fehlende Schnittstellen und unterschiedliche Dateiformate Foto: genua GmbH BOS stehen deshalb bei der digitalen Transformation an mehreren Brennpunkten unter Erfolgsdruck: Leistungsfähige Schnittstellen müssen Hürden beim Informationsaustausch beseitigen; zugleich sollen zeitgemäße und zukunftssichere Lösungen für die mobile Datenkommunikation einen stetig steigenden Bedarf decken Und natürlich ist eine reibungslose Kommunikation nicht das einzige Ziel Organisationen im öffentlichen Sektor sind laufend von Cyberattacken Datenspionage oder Sabotage bedroht Der wirksame Schutz ihrer digitalen Infrastrukturen und Kommunikationsnetze ist deshalb von zentraler Bedeutung Digitale Souveränität für zukunftsorientierte Behörden Eine zentrale Aufgabe bei der Digitalisierung besteht einerseits darin effektive und sichere Kommunikationskanäle über alle Ebenen hinweg zu schaffen Andererseits müssen Anwendungen und Daten so einsatzgerecht kombiniert werden dass alle Beteiligten die Ressourcen effektiv nutzen können Interoperabilität sowie die Fähigkeit Daten bei Wahrung ihrer Vertraulichkeit und Integrität über offene Schnittstellen zu verteilen sind essenzielle Eckpfeiler digitaler Souveränität Um reibungsloses staatliches Handeln von BOS auch in Krisensituationen zu gewährleisten sollten Schlüsseltechnologien wie Kommunikations-, IT- und Sicherheitstechnik grundsätzlich aus vertrauenswürdigen Quellen bezogen werden Die genua GmbH ist deutscher IT Security Hersteller mit umfassendem Know-how und einem breiten Leistungsangebot Als Tochterunternehmen der Bundesdruckerei ist genua langjähriger Vertrauenspartner und „Qualifizierter Partner“ des BSI Systemlösung von genua für VS-NfD-Kommunikation Die VS-NfD-Zulassungen für die Sicherheitslösungen von genua – ob für den mobilen Einsatz oder den sicheren Datenaustausch von VS-NfD-Daten – belegen hohe Qualität und Vertrauenswürdigkeit Denn als einziger Hersteller bietet genua zur Abschirmung sensibler Daten hochsichere Firewalls die vom Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik BSI"

The news section,The news section
"The news section (with its local, national, and international subsections), the sports section, the arts section, the living section, the opinion pages: they’d all been fed through a shredder, then thrown into a wind tunnel. What appeared on the screen was a jumble, high mixed with low, silly with smart, tragic with trivial. The cacophony of the RSS feed, it’s now clear, heralded a sea change in the distribution and consumption of information. The new order would be disorder. The collapse gained momentum after Facebook introduced its News Feed in 2006. To a dog’s breakfast of news headlines, the News Feed added a dog’s breakfast of personal posts and messages and then mixed in another dog’s breakfast of sponsored posts and ads. It looked, smelled, and tasted like the meal Brad Pitt feeds his pitbull in Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood . After a brief period of complaining, with the usual and empty #deletefacebook threats, the public embraced the News Feed. The convenience of getting all content of interest through a single stream — no need to jump from site to site anymore — overrode the initial concerns. Now, everything would take the form of an “update.” In discussing the appeal of the News Feed in that same interview with Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg observed, “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.” The statement is grotesque not because it’s false — it’s completely true — but because it’s a category error. It yokes together in an obscene comparison two events of radically different scale and import. And yet, in his tone-deaf way, Zuckerberg managed to express the reality of content collapse. When it comes to information, social media renders category errors obsolete. The rise of the smartphone has completed the collapse of content. The diminutive size of the device’s screen further compacted all forms of information. The instant notifications and infinite scrolls that became the phone’s default design standards required that all information be rendered in a way that could be taken in at a glance, further blurring the old distinctions between types of content. Now all information belongs to a single category, and it all pours through a single channel. Many of the qualities of social media that make people uneasy stem from content collapse. First, by leveling everything, social media also trivializes everything — freed of barriers, information, like water, pools at the lowest possible level. A presidential candidate’s policy announcement is given equal weight to a snapshot of your niece’s hamster and a video of the latest Kardashian contouring. Second, as all information consolidates on social media, we respond to it using the same small set of tools the platforms provide for us. Our responses become homogenized, too. That’s true of both the form of the responses (repost, retweet, like, heart, hashtag, fire emoji) and their content (Love! Hate! Cringe!)",The news section with its local national and international subsections the sports section the arts section the living section the opinion pages: they’d all been fed through a shredder then thrown into a wind tunnel What appeared on the screen was a jumble high mixed with low silly with smart tragic with trivial The cacophony of the RSS feed it’s now clear heralded a sea change in the distribution and consumption of information The new order would be disorder The collapse gained momentum after Facebook introduced its News Feed in 2006 To a dog’s breakfast of news headlines the News Feed added a dog’s breakfast of personal posts and messages and then mixed in another dog’s breakfast of sponsored posts and ads It looked smelled and tasted like the meal Brad Pitt feeds his pitbull in Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood .

"Video Sequence Editor (VSE) wurde das Aussehen der Strips angepasst. Die Anfasser sind jetzt deutlich schmaler und wenn man bei Videostrips die Deckkraft oder bei Audiostrips die Lautstärke animiert hat, werden die dazugehörigen Kurven jetzt direkt im Strip angezeigt. Zum Bearbeiten muss man aber weiter zum Graph Editor greifen. Auf der linken Seite des Editorfensters wurde dem VSE ein Toolshelf spendiert, wie er in den meisten anderen Editoren ebenfalls zu finden ist. Noch ist die Auswahl an Werkzeugen gering. Mit der “Blade” kann man einen Strip in zwei Hälften teilen und die Farbpipette zeigt den Farbwert unter dem Mauscursor an. Dazu kommen die üblichen Werkzeuge für Auswahl und Annotation. Es ist aber davon auszugehen, dass in Zukunft noch mehr nachgereicht wird. Die Strips im Video Sequence Editor (VSE) haben einen neuen Look und zeigen jetzt Animationskurven für Lautstärke und Deckkraft direkt an. Der Cache im VSE kann jetzt auf die SSD ausgelagert werden. Um Zugriffszeiten zu sparen, werden jeweils 100 Frames auf einmal in den Cache geschrieben. Das bedeutet, dass bei jeder Änderung alle 100 Bilder neu berechnet werden müssen, eine Einschränkung, die bei Bildern im Arbeitsspeicher nicht gegeben ist. Stoffe lassen sich jetzt von Hand falten Der Sculptingmodus hat eine Stoffsimulation erhalten. Normalerweise funktionieren die Werkzeuge beim Sculpting ähnlich als würde man Lehm oder Ton mit den Händen oder mit Werkzeugen formen, woher auch die Bezeichnung Sculpting kommt. Für diese Arbeitszweise wurde ein weiterer “Brush” hinzugefügt. Der Clay Thumb-Brush erzeugt ein Ergebnis, als würde man mit dem Daumen über Lehm streichen, wobei sich ein wenig Material an der Daumenspitze ansammelt. Der neue Cloth Brush hingegen verhält sich eher so, als würde man an einer Tischdecke zupfen und ziehen, wodurch realistische Falten entstehen. Mit dem Brush kann man also sehr schnell ein Bett unordentlich machen oder Kleidung physikalisch korrekt anpassen und verschieben. Blender hat zwar schon eine Stoffsimulation integriert, der neue Cloth Brush erlaubt aber eine nie dagewesene lokale Kontrolle der Simulation. Haare leichter Kämmen Der Smooth Brush hat eine neue Methode ""Surface"" erhalten, mit der nur feine Details geglättet werden, während die allgemeine Form des Objekts erhalten bleibt. Die Haarsimulation in Blender nutzt jetzt die gleichen Algorithmen zu Berechnung von Kollisionen wie die Stoffsimulation. Die Interaktion von Haaren mit Oberflächen wird dadurch viel realistischer und weniger fehleranfällig. Bei Selbstkollisionen konnte dank Optimierungen ein Performanceschub von 15 bis 20 Prozent realisiert werden, wovon sowohl die Stoff- als auch die Haarsimulation profitieren. Mantaflow Die kombinierte Simulation von Flüssigkeiten, Feuer und Rauch Mantaflow hat diverse Optimierungen erhalten und den Cache jetzt standardmäßig auf Replay, wodurch man nur noch im Viewport die Animation starten muss. Der Cache wird, wo nötig automatisch neu gebacken. Sich schnell bewegende Hindernisse interagieren jetzt auch zwischen zwei Frames mit Flüssigkeiten und sollte Flüssigkeit in Kollisionsobjekte eintreten, kann diese jetzt automatisch gelöscht werden. Grease Pencil Der Grease Pencil, mit dem man in Blender 2D-Zeichnungen erstellen kann, hat eine neue Engine erhalten. Dadurch sollten kantige Ecken bei schnellen Strichen der Vergangenheit angehören und man kann die Zeichnungen jetzt beliebig einfärben, quasi die Zeichnung mit Nachhinein kolorieren. Dafür hat das Grease Pencil-Objekt einen eigenen Vertex Paint-Modus erhalten, der sich verhält wie sein Pendant für dreidimensionale Objekte. Allgemein wurde die Bedienung des Grease Pencils an vielen Stellen leicht an die herkömmliche Bedienung von Blender angepasst. So werden jetzt im Sculpt- und Weightpaint-Modus für Grease Pencil Objekte die gleichen Brushes mit der gleichen Bedienung eingesetzt wie im normalen Sculpt- und Weight Paint-Modus. Modifier Auch die Modifier wurden vom Aussehen und Verhalten her an die regulären Modifier angepasst. Sie können jetzt per Verlinkung übertragen werden und bei einigen kann jetzt über eine Einflusskurve das Verhalten gesteuert werden. Bei den Modifiern für 3D-Objekte hat sich ebenfalls einiges getan. Der Ocean Modifier kann jetzt nicht nur stürmische, aufwühlte Seen simulieren, sondern auch ein ruhiges Meer und flache Küstengewässer. Außerdem soll die allgemeine Form gewahrt bleiben, wenn man die Auflösung ändert. Der Solidify Modifier kann jetzt die neu erzeugte Geometrie eigenen Vertextruppen zuweisen, wobei Hülle und Rand separat behandelt werden. Außerdem arbeitet er jetzt besser mit einem nachfolgenden Bevel Modifier zusammen. Der Remesh Modifier unterstützt jetzt das auf OpenVDB basierende Voxel Remesh-Verfahren, welches bisher nur als Operator genutzt werden konnte. Voxel Remesh erzeugt ein Mesh, das nur aus Quads besteht und dadurch vor vielen Shadingartefakten gefeit ist und sich gut als Basis für Sculpting eignet. Bugfixing Sprint Als LTS-Version wurde bei Blender 2.83 ein besonderes Augenmerk auf Stabilität gelegt. Daher haben die Entwickler, die von der Blender Foundation oder vom Blender Institute angestellt sind, zwei Wochen lang ausschließlich Bugfixing und Qualitätssicherung betrieben. Und obwohl mehr als 1000 Bugs beseitigt wurden – ganz fehlerfrei ist die Software natürlich noch nicht, zukünftige Fixes sollen aber für einen Zeitraum von zwei Jahre rückportiert werden. Die nächste Version soll in ca. drei Monaten erscheinen und wird die Versionsnummer 2.90 tragen. Wenn alles nach Plan verläuft, erscheinen ab jetzt einmal im Quartal Minor-Releases und einmal im Jahr ein Major-Release, das dann wieder LTS gepflegt wird. Blender 2.83 läuft unter Windows, Mac OS und Linux und steht ab sofort zum Download bereit . In den ausführlichen Release Notes werden einige der neuen Features interaktiv demonstriert. ( axk )","Video Sequence Editor VSE wurde das Aussehen der Strips angepasst Die Anfasser sind jetzt deutlich schmaler und wenn man bei Videostrips die Deckkraft oder bei Audiostrips die Lautstärke animiert hat werden die dazugehörigen Kurven jetzt direkt im Strip angezeigt Zum Bearbeiten muss man aber weiter zum Graph Editor greifen Auf der linken Seite des Editorfensters wurde dem VSE ein Toolshelf spendiert wie er in den meisten anderen Editoren ebenfalls zu finden ist Noch ist die Auswahl an Werkzeugen gering Mit der “Blade” kann man einen Strip in zwei Hälften teilen und die Farbpipette zeigt den Farbwert unter dem Mauscursor an Dazu kommen die üblichen Werkzeuge für Auswahl und Annotation Es ist aber davon auszugehen dass in Zukunft noch mehr nachgereicht wird Die Strips im Video Sequence Editor VSE haben einen neuen Look und zeigen jetzt Animationskurven für Lautstärke und Deckkraft direkt an Der Cache im VSE kann jetzt auf die SSD ausgelagert werden Um Zugriffszeiten zu sparen werden jeweils 100 Frames auf einmal in den Cache geschrieben Das bedeutet dass bei jeder Änderung alle 100 Bilder neu berechnet werden müssen eine Einschränkung die bei Bildern im Arbeitsspeicher nicht gegeben ist Stoffe lassen sich jetzt von Hand falten Der Sculptingmodus hat eine Stoffsimulation erhalten Normalerweise funktionieren die Werkzeuge beim Sculpting ähnlich als würde man Lehm oder Ton mit den Händen oder mit Werkzeugen formen woher auch die Bezeichnung Sculpting kommt Für diese Arbeitszweise wurde ein weiterer “Brush” hinzugefügt Der Clay Thumb-Brush erzeugt ein Ergebnis als würde man mit dem Daumen über Lehm streichen wobei sich ein wenig Material an der Daumenspitze ansammelt Der neue Cloth Brush hingegen verhält sich eher so als würde man an einer Tischdecke zupfen und ziehen wodurch realistische Falten entstehen Mit dem Brush kann man also sehr schnell ein Bett unordentlich machen oder Kleidung physikalisch korrekt anpassen und verschieben Blender hat zwar schon eine Stoffsimulation integriert der neue Cloth Brush erlaubt aber eine nie dagewesene lokale Kontrolle der Simulation Haare leichter Kämmen Der Smooth Brush hat eine neue Methode ""Surface"" erhalten mit der nur feine Details geglättet werden während die allgemeine Form des Objekts erhalten bleibt Die Haarsimulation in Blender nutzt jetzt die gleichen Algorithmen zu Berechnung von Kollisionen wie die Stoffsimulation Die Interaktion von Haaren mit Oberflächen wird dadurch viel realistischer und weniger fehleranfällig Bei Selbstkollisionen konnte dank Optimierungen ein Performanceschub von 15 bis 20 Prozent realisiert werden wovon sowohl die Stoff- als auch die Haarsimulation profitieren Mantaflow Die kombinierte Simulation von Flüssigkeiten Feuer und Rauch Mantaflow hat diverse Optimierungen erhalten und den Cache jetzt standardmäßig auf Replay wodurch man nur noch im Viewport die Animation starten muss Der Cache wird wo nötig automatisch neu gebacken Sich schnell bewegende Hindernisse interagieren jetzt auch zwischen zwei Frames mit Flüssigkeiten und sollte Flüssigkeit in Kollisionsobjekte eintreten kann diese jetzt automatisch gelöscht werden Grease Pencil Der Grease Pencil mit dem man in Blender 2D-Zeichnungen erstellen kann hat eine neue Engine erhalten Dadurch sollten kantige Ecken bei schnellen Strichen der Vergangenheit angehören und man kann die Zeichnungen jetzt beliebig einfärben quasi die Zeichnung mit Nachhinein kolorieren Dafür hat das Grease Pencil-Objekt einen eigenen Vertex Paint-Modus erhalten der sich verhält wie sein Pendant für dreidimensionale Objekte Allgemein wurde die Bedienung des Grease Pencils an vielen Stellen leicht an die herkömmliche Bedienung von Blender angepasst So werden jetzt im Sculpt- und Weightpaint-Modus für Grease Pencil Objekte die gleichen Brushes mit der gleichen Bedienung eingesetzt wie im normalen Sculpt- und Weight Paint-Modus Modifier Auch die Modifier

"While obesity (but not facial unattractiveness) has been shown to be associated with lower educational attainment, 17 and obese high school students are less likely to attend college, 18 there is little empiric evidence to attribute this to weight-based discrimination in the admissions process. Nor have any studies, to our knowledge, found evidence of discrimination in higher education admissions based on facial attractiveness. The requirement for a photograph in graduate medical education (GME) applications introduces the potential for bias based on physical attributes 19 and presents an opportunity to study the impact of applicants’ physical appearance on the selection process. In this study, we carried out a simulated resident selection process in which core faculty at 5 academic radiology departments reviewed and scored fictitious residency applications, believing they were evaluating actual applicants as part of their department’s resident selection process. Our goal was to evaluate for appearance-based discrimination in the selection of GME residents to radiology residency. Method Subjects Volunteers were solicited from the core faculty of 5 geographically diverse academic radiology departments (Duke University, University of Indiana, Mayo Clinic, University of New Mexico, and Stanford University)",While obesity but not facial unattractiveness has been shown to be associated with lower educational attainment 17 and obese high school students are less likely to attend college 18 there is little empiric evidence to attribute this to weight-based discrimination in the admissions process Nor have any studies to our knowledge found evidence of discrimination in higher education admissions based on facial attractiveness The requirement for a photograph in graduate medical education GME applications introduces the potential for bias based on physical attributes 19 and presents an opportunity to study the impact of applicants’ physical appearance on the selection process In this study we carried out a simulated resident selection process in which core faculty at 5 academic radiology departments reviewed and scored fictitious residency applications believing they were evaluating actual applicants as part of their department’s resident selection process Our goal was to evaluate for appearance-based discrimination in the selection of GME residents to radiology residency Method Subjects Volunteers were solicited from the core faculty of 5 geographically diverse academic radiology departments Duke University University of Indiana Mayo Clinic University of New Mexico and Stanford University

"[8] Simoni concludes that ""On the traditional/secular dimension, the United States ranks far below other rich societies, with levels of religiosity and national pride comparable with those found in some developing societies."" [5] Asian societies are distributed in the traditional/secular dimension in two clusters, with more secular Confucian societies at the top, and more traditional South Asian ones at the center of the map. [9] Russia is among the most survival-value oriented countries, and at the other end, Sweden ranks highest on the self-expression chart. [4] It has also been found that basic cultural values overwhelmingly apply on national lines, with cross-border intermixtures being relatively rare. This is true even between countries with shared cultural histories. Additionally, even cultural clusters of countries do not intermix much across borders. This suggests nations are culturally meaningful units. [10] History [ edit ] The map is updated and modified regularly along with the new waves of data from the World Values Survey .

"a Software Development Kit (SDK) for Quest hand tracking will go live for Oculus developers, which will allow them to tap into Oculus' hand-tracking system and potentially implement it in various games and apps. And second, Oculus is limiting its hand-tracking framework to the Quest ecosystem. This update isn't coming to the PC-centric Rift or Rift S headsets, and it won't work if you use Oculus Link to connect a Quest to your favorite PC VR games. First of its kind, for a reason Normally in VR, users grab onto controllers full of triggers and buttons. For some VR software, a piece of handheld plastic makes sense: it can sell the sensation of holding a weapon or VR item, and it adds haptic feedback like rumbling when your real-life hand gets near VR objects. But there's something to be said about lifting your empty hands in the VR sky and seeing your real fingers wiggle, which, based on pre-release tests, we can confirm Oculus Quest hand tracking nails. We've seen hand-tracking experiments on other VR headsets, but these have largely come in the form of proprietary add-ons like Leap Motion, which require additional hardware and a bolted-on rendering pipeline. These systems have been impressive enough as tested at various tech expos, but VR hand tracking has always been underwhelming in execution— just imprecise enough, in terms of recognizing individual fingers and ""pinch"" gestures, compared to the ""it just works"" appeal of a compatible controller. Quest's native hand-tracking support, on the other hand, taps into the headset's existing camera array, and it may very well work without adding a processing burden to the system (though we'll have to wait for the SDK to know for sure). That reduced friction is the best news for a hand-tracking system that, at launch, is admittedly simple and limited. “Fwshht” like Wolverine, but not yet Right now, Quest turns your empty hands into laser pointers that can manipulate menus. Leave your hands somewhat open, like you're about to pinch a pesky fly buzzing around, to make a pointer appear on a distant menu, as aimed by your hands' orientation. Quickly pinch your index finger and thumb to ""click"" any menu buttons, or hold your pinch to drag menu elements like a scrolling list or volume slider. Based on tests in October , we know that the system natively recognizes a few hand gestures, particularly the balling of fists. (In one fantasy-themed test, I could dunk my real-life hands in a vat of virtual goo, then ball my hands into fists to make Wolverine-like blades ""fwsshht"" out of my virtual knuckles.)","a Software Development Kit SDK for Quest hand tracking will go live for Oculus developers which will allow them to tap into Oculus' hand-tracking system and potentially implement it in various games and apps And second Oculus is limiting its hand-tracking framework to the Quest ecosystem This update isn't coming to the PC-centric Rift or Rift S headsets and it won't work if you use Oculus Link to connect a Quest to your favorite PC VR games First of its kind for a reason Normally in VR users grab onto controllers full of triggers and buttons For some VR software a piece of handheld plastic makes sense: it can sell the sensation of holding a weapon or VR item and it adds haptic feedback like rumbling when your real-life hand gets near VR objects But there's something to be said about lifting your empty hands in the VR sky and seeing your real fingers wiggle which based on pre-release tests we can confirm Oculus Quest hand tracking nails We've seen hand-tracking experiments on other VR headsets but these have largely come in the form of proprietary add-ons like Leap Motion which require additional hardware and a bolted-on rendering pipeline These systems have been impressive enough as tested at various tech expos but VR hand tracking has always been underwhelming in execution— just imprecise enough in terms of recognizing individual fingers and ""pinch"" gestures compared to the ""it just works"" appeal of a compatible controller Quest's native hand-tracking support on the other hand taps into the headset's existing camera array and it may very well work without adding a processing burden to the system though we'll have to wait for the SDK to know for sure That reduced friction is the best news for a hand-tracking system that at launch is admittedly simple and limited “Fwshht” like Wolverine but not yet Right now Quest turns your empty hands into laser pointers that can manipulate menus Leave your hands somewhat open like you're about to pinch a pesky fly buzzing around to make a pointer appear on a distant menu as aimed by your hands' orientation Quickly pinch your index finger and thumb to ""click"" any menu buttons or hold your pinch to drag menu elements like a scrolling list or volume slider Based on tests in October , we know that the system natively recognizes a few hand gestures particularly the balling of fists In one fantasy-themed test I could dunk my real-life hands in a vat of virtual goo then ball my hands into fists to make Wolverine-like blades ""fwsshht"" out of my virtual knuckles."

Indeed, ineffective diversity-related training programs often crowd out much more substantial efforts that could be undertaken to actually enhance diversity and inclusion within institutions of higher learning. Why do universities instead double-down on training despite its demonstrated ineffectiveness? The short answer is that, even if training is expensive and doesn’t work, it is relatively easy to implement – and it allows universities to show (including, often, in court ) that they are doing something to address prejudice, discrimination and inequalities… even if what they’re doing is, in fact, pointless. However, universities are institutions that regularly claim to embody and inculcate such values as evidence-based reasoning, respect for facts, commitment to truth, etc. Universities are doing a bad job at modeling those values for students insofar as they force upon them (and upon the faculty who are supposed to be instructing them!)",and contingent faculty are being laid off en masse disproportionately people from historically underrepresented and disadvantaged groups .

"and timing (PNT) capability solution for the US Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) programme, potentially featuring a hybrid variant of the company’s two premiere GPS master clock and network time server platforms. Company officials are developing initial design proposals for the PNT capability for the LTAMDS with programme officials from the army and prime contractor Raytheon, said Hironori Sasaki, president of Orolia Defense & Security. Raytheon selected Orolia to support PNT capability development for the air and missile sensor programme on 8 July. “The approach we have taken ... is we have really looked at the solution to the problem through a layered approach,” Sasaki said on 13 July. “In the world of PNT there is no single technology that is going to solve the problem for all of every single one of our customers, or every single environment we see these products go into,” he added. Army officials envision the LTAMDS, as designed, as the eventual replacement for the legacy Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target anti-air and missile radar system. Company officials say the new LTAMDS will provide double the radar detection and power capabilities compared with the current systems, while maintaining the same size and weight ratios as the legacy radar.

approaching geometry as the study of invariants,approaching geometry as the study of invariants
"approaching geometry as the study of invariants (properties unchanged under some class of transformations) viewed as symmetries of these geometries. The Erlangen Programme has had a profound impact on geometry, and the pervasive Category theory in pure mathematics can be regarded as a continuation of it. The Erlangen Programme demonstrates that all geometries are simply special cases of a projective geometry. Klein associated every geometry with an underlying group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries could thus be mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these groups and a hierarchy of their invariants. The researchers behind the new paper liken the current state of deep learning (DL) research to that of 19th-century research on geometry. On the one hand, DL has brought a revolutionary approach to many tasks. On the other hand, few unifying principles have been developed for the variety of DL architectures used with different kinds of datasets. This makes it difficult to understand the relationships between different DL approaches, and has resulted in an often-confusing reinvention and re-branding of the same concepts. The researchers apply the Erlangen Programme mindset to the DL domain, aiming to build a systematization that can derive different inductive biases and network architectures, implementing them from first principles of symmetry and invariance. Their “Geometric Deep Learning” geometrization approach provides a common mathematical framework to derive the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers; while introducing a constructive procedure for building future architectures in a principled way. The team focuses on the 5Gs of geometric domains: graphs, grids, groups, geodesics, and gauges. Groups applies to global symmetry transformations in homogeneous space, geodesics to metric structures on manifolds, and gauges to the local reference frames defined on tangent bundles. The researchers say the geometric principles of symmetry, geometric stability, and scale separation can be combined to provide a universal blueprint for geometric deep learning; and that the geometry of an input domain provides three key building blocks: 1)",approaching geometry as the study of invariants properties unchanged under some class of transformations viewed as symmetries of these geometries The Erlangen Programme has had a profound impact on geometry and the pervasive Category theory in pure mathematics can be regarded as a continuation of it The Erlangen Programme demonstrates that all geometries are simply special cases of a projective geometry Klein associated every geometry with an underlying group of symmetries The hierarchy of geometries could thus be mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these groups and a hierarchy of their invariants The researchers behind the new paper liken the current state of deep learning DL research to that of 19th-century research on geometry On the one hand DL has brought a revolutionary approach to many tasks On the other hand few unifying principles have been developed for the variety of DL architectures used with different kinds of datasets This makes it difficult to understand the relationships between different DL approaches and has resulted in an often-confusing reinvention and re-branding of the same concepts The researchers apply the Erlangen Programme mindset to the DL domain aiming to build a systematization that can derive different inductive biases and network architectures implementing them from first principles of symmetry and invariance Their “Geometric Deep Learning” geometrization approach provides a common mathematical framework to derive the most successful neural network architectures such as CNNs RNNs GNNs and Transformers; while introducing a constructive procedure for building future architectures in a principled way The team focuses on the 5Gs of geometric domains: graphs grids groups geodesics and gauges Groups applies to global symmetry transformations in homogeneous space geodesics to metric structures on manifolds and gauges to the local reference frames defined on tangent bundles The researchers say the geometric principles of symmetry geometric stability and scale separation can be combined to provide a universal blueprint for geometric deep learning; and that the geometry of an input domain provides three key building blocks: 1

assuming a 15% threshold for recommendation for interview,assuming a 15% threshold for recommendation for interview
"assuming a 15% threshold for recommendation for interview (the average of the 5 participating residency programs), an applicant who is obese and facially unattractive is 14% less likely to receive an interview than is an applicant who is nonobese and facially attractive, according to our model. Our study builds on similar work in the business literature demonstrating improved hiring rates for attractive individuals, but few studies have explored this phenomenon in the higher education admissions process. No published studies, to our knowledge, have demonstrated discrimination in admissions based on the facial attractiveness of applicants, but 2 studies found evidence for weight-based discrimination. In 1966, Canning and Mayer showed that obese students were less likely to be accepted into elite colleges, 24 and more recently, Burmeister and colleagues demonstrated that applicants with a higher body mass index were less likely to be offered a position in a graduate psychology program. 25 The design of our study, which simulated the actual resident selection process through deception of the application reviewers, allowed us to control for several confounding variables present in prior studies. By using a single photograph as a surrogate for attractiveness, we were able to isolate the physical features of the applicant and eliminate confounders that might otherwise manifest in the admissions process. In Burmeister and colleagues’ study, personal interviews were used to evaluate the influence of applicant obesity on admissions decisions, but this methodology failed to control for indirect factors known to be correlates of obesity, such as self-confidence and interpersonal skills. 26 Canning’s methodology, a retrospective review of admission data, is similarly plagued by confounders that correlate with obesity and facial unattractiveness, such as letters of recommendation, 27 extracurricular activities, 26 and grades. 28 This problem was avoided in our study by use of fictitious applicants, the randomization of all academic variables, the exclusion of letters of recommendation, and the inclusion of only noninfluencing extracurricular activities and premedical accomplishments. Although it was not the primary focus of the study, we also evaluated the influence of race and gender. Applicant race was strongly influential on reviewer rating, as reviewers favored black and Hispanic applicants over white and Asian applicants. We do not consider our results inconsistent with recent studies that show implicit antiblack bias in doctors 29 and in a medical school admission committee, 30 but rather our results illustrate that implicit bias may not be a reliable predictor of behavior and should not be presumed to be a surrogate for discrimination. We suspect that our reviewers were prioritizing applicants they believed best met institutional goals and values. Regarding applicant gender, published studies in the psychology and business literature suggest that the influence of physical appearance may be stronger for female applicants than for male applicants, 31 but the results are inconsistent. 32 We found no significant influence of applicant gender, reviewer gender, or their interaction. We find no reason to believe that our findings are limited to radiology resident selection. Implicit antiobesity attitudes are widely held, 33 and those held by health professionals 34 may manifest behaviorally in clinical decision making. 35 Unlike in business, where physical attractiveness has been shown to correlate with success, 36 there is no justification in medicine for bias based on physical appearance. Resident selection committees should invoke strategies to detect and manage appearance-based bias. Existing diversity training programs should consider including, or emphasizing, education to counter appearance-based bias in their curricula. ERAS should reconsider the role of photographs in the application process. This study has several limitations. We used deception to simulate the resident selection process, but there were differences in our applications, and in our application process, which might have resulted in our subjects behaving differently from actual reviewers of real applications. Our mock applications omitted important application factors (personal statements, letters of recommendation) for greater efficiency in review and to eliminate confounders; psychology research suggests that with less information, reviewers are more likely to rely on nonacademic factors. 37 Our reviewers might have weighed certain academic or nonacademic factors differently from those primarily responsible for application screening during the concurrent application cycle, or from those reviewers with more experience in the task. We attempted to compensate for this by including only core faculty with experience in evaluating residency or fellow applicants. Only volunteer activities and premedical accomplishments felt to be noninfluential by 3 experienced program directors were included in the applications, but it is possible that individual supporting variables might have influenced certain reviewers. Limited demographic data were collected for subjects, to ensure anonymity given the sensitive nature of the research question, and to maintain compliance with our waiver of consent. The attractiveness and obesity of applicants were determined by a panel of radiologists. A larger panel, or one with a different composition of members, might have rated photographs differently. We attempted to compensate for this by choosing applicant photographs with narrow interrater variability. Assessment of physical attractiveness is subjective and may be subject to cultural and social forces. 38 , 39 Photographs were used as a static cue for obesity. This simplifies and may underestimate the influence of obesity. To maximize statistical power, certain demographic groups were over- or underrepresented in our study. Females accounted for only 29% of applications to radiology programs in 2017 40 but comprised 47% of applicants in our experiment. Blacks accounted for just 6% of applicants to radiology programs in 2017 but in our experiment accounted for 29%. Obese applicants were overrepresented in our simulated application pool, in the subjective opinion of our experienced program directors. In conclusion, our study provides preliminary evidence for discrimination against facially unattractive and obese applicants in admissions to GME radiology residency programs. We hope these findings raise the awareness of admissions decision makers as to the potential influence of appearance-based bias. We recommend that ERAS reconsider the role of photographs in the GME application process. References 1. Thorndike EL. A constant error in psychological ratings. J Appl Psychol. 1920;4:25–29. 2.

psychology research suggests that with less information reviewers are more likely to rely on nonacademic factors 37 Our reviewers might have weighed certain academic or nonacademic factors differently from those primarily responsible for application screening during the concurrent application cycle or from those reviewers with more experience in the task We attempted to compensate for this by including only core faculty with experience in evaluating residency or fellow applicants Only volunteer activities and premedical accomplishments felt to be noninfluential by 3 experienced program directors were included in the applications but it is possible that individual supporting variables might have influenced certain reviewers Limited demographic data were collected for subjects to ensure anonymity given the sensitive nature of the research question and to maintain compliance with our waiver of consent The attractiveness and obesity of applicants were determined by a panel of radiologists A larger panel or one with a different composition of members might have rated photographs differently We attempted to compensate for this by choosing applicant photographs with narrow interrater variability Assessment of physical attractiveness is subjective and may be subject to cultural and social forces 38 , 39 Photographs were used as a static cue for obesity This simplifies and may underestimate the influence of obesity To maximize statistical power certain demographic groups were over- or underrepresented in our study Females accounted for only 29% of applications to radiology programs in 2017 40 but comprised 47% of applicants in our experiment Blacks accounted for just 6% of applicants to radiology programs in 2017 but in our experiment accounted for 29%. Obese applicants were overrepresented in our simulated application pool in the subjective opinion of our experienced program directors In conclusion our study provides preliminary evidence for discrimination against facially unattractive and obese applicants in admissions to GME radiology residency programs We hope these findings raise the awareness of admissions decision makers as to the potential influence of appearance-based bias We recommend that ERAS reconsider the role of photographs in the GME application process References 1 Thorndike EL A constant error in psychological ratings J Appl Psychol 1920;4:25–29 2 Dion K Berscheid E Walster E What is beautiful is good J Pers Soc Psychol 1972;24:285–290 3 Cramer P Steinwert T Thin is good fat is bad: How early does it begin?

"called SIMNET (short for “simulator networking”). Ethernet cables snaked out from their M1 Abrams tank simulators, plugging the First Company of the 12th Armored Cavalry Unit into one collective virtual training ground. As the instructor uploaded Soviet computer-generated tanks and armored vehicles into the scenario, emulating Soviet doctrine to the best of his ability, the U.S. troops ranged across the virtual desert, in an attempt to outwit and out-fire their adversary. The Soviet and U.S. forces engaged, clashing in a fierce melee of man and materiel, but U.S. command and control quickly began to disintegrate. American troops began to virtually die at the hands of the adversary or, in the midst of the confusion, via fratricide. The troop screens in the tank simulators turned blank, as if to signal the onset of their mass extinction. The battle had ended, but for these soldiers the training had not yet finished. SIMNET allowed the soldiers to replay aspects of the battle “ Groundhog Day-style ” and identify their mistakes and failings. They could experientially learn before the crucible of combat, and not via a prohibitively costly, one-off exercise. SIMNET was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (the precursor to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA) in partnership with the U.S. Army between 1983 and 1990. Conceptualized by Jack Thorpe in 1978, SIMNET was the first demonstration of an extensive simulator network for collective team training and mission rehearsal . Prior to the 1980s, simulators were developed as stand-alone systems designed for platform-specific training needs, like pilot instrumentation training. Thorpe, however, felt that simulation could augment live training, not just act as a substitute. He believed that a synthetic environment could be used to teach necessary combat skills — like large-scale collective coordination — that were challenging to learn in peacetime. SIMNET sought to solve that problem by developing a scalable and cost-effective virtual architecture that networked simulators together into one collective synthetic (i.e., virtual and constructive )","called SIMNET short for “simulator networking”.

"dressed up to imitate the black-and-white dazzle camouflage (AKA razzle-dazzle) used on naval ships. In Martelli and Gibson’s environment, you can jump between different scenes, each with their own giddying perspectives, algorithmic choreography and psychedelic dancing figures – humanoid, geometric or entirely abstract – that can pass right through you like digital ectoplasm. It’s pure fantasy – and dazzling though it is, the rarefied solo experience feels a little self-isolating. I can imagine the unquarantined gallery installation being more of a ball. Cinematic sets ... Toby Coffey’s All Kinds of Limbo. Photograph: Courtesy: LFF Toby Coffey’s All Kinds of Limbo is another single-user version of a “multiplayer” project, this time developed in response to the National Theatre production of Andrea Levy’s Small Island (and inaugurating a partnership between LFF Expanded and the NT’s Immersive Storytelling Studio ). It is indeed much closer to theatre: song-and-dance numbers performed by Nubiya Brandon that track a Caribbean lineage in British music – calypso, reggae, grime – albeit in sets that are cinematic rather than stagey: a long, lonely street, a cartoonishly treated backing band, a room of digitally melting colours. Crucially, Brandon appears volumetrically real: three-dimensional, with a swing to her moves, and she catches your eye as she sings. Simulation of course, but with a palpably physical effect: I couldn’t help but bop along. Gimme One by Harry Silverlock and Montague Fitzgerald is in some ways a standard film documentary – slices of life intercut with seated people giving viewpoints, and stitched together with links, illustrations and interludes – but it uses a 360° film format, motion capture and volumetric filming to particular effect: to open up what you might call a virtual safe space between subject and viewer. The film was co-created with a British ballroom community – a network of LGBTQI people, especially of colour – and it explores how music, costume and vogue dance engenders the ballroom itself as a safe space of expression and connection for them. The VR format gives the viewer a vivid experience of that space without physically intruding upon it. Multisensorial voyeurism, a new means of self-representation or a bridge for embodied understanding? A fluctuating mix of all three, I guess. Virtual safe space ...

"entertainment zone to be funded by R80bn (£4.2bn) of investment over 15 years. Hailed by an excited media as an “ African Manhattan ” or a new New York for the continent, the view from the top of the tallest Modderfontein towers would have passed over the densely packed Alexandra township to the very real steel and glass of Johannesburg’s existing financial centre in Sandton five miles to the west, where the latest skyscraper, the 234-metre Leonardo, has just taken the crown as Africa’s tallest building . Modderfontein was to be to Johannesburg what Eko Atlantic is to Lagos, Nigeria – a shiny new start on the periphery of an African city that promised to fix all its existing problems. Footprint of a city that never was: a road ends abruptly in a barrier, with the Modderfontein nature reserve behind Beyond a few connector roads and streetlights the Chinese developer’s dream never became reality. Refusal to agree to the Johannesburg authorities’ demand for affordable housing meant planning permission was never granted. The land ended up being quietly sold, and resold, and is now in the hands of a company that appears to be developing the site piecemeal into a series of gated communities. Q&A What is South African cities week? Show Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope.  Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes. Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the ""other Soweto"", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of  zama zama  gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper. Nick Van Mead “The sale of the land and failure of the project was never really publicly announced,” says UCL research fellow Frances Brill who studied the case in depth with Ricardo Reboredo from the University of Dublin. During a three-year period Brill and Reboredo interviewed 50 consultants, architects, engineers and local authority planners involved to piece together what happened. Did Modderfontein’s failure prevent the gap widening between an aspirational “world-class city” project and the reality faced by the majority of Johannesburg’s population – or should it be seen as a missed opportunity? ‘The future capital of the whole of Africa’ Back in 2013 when the project first hit the headlines Zendai Group chairman Dai Zhikang told the South China Morning Post the development would act as a hub for Chinese firms investing in sub-Saharan Africa. With funds from the Bank of China, Zendai had bought Modderfontein from Heartland, the property development arm of explosives and chemicals company AECI. The area had been the site of South Africa’s first dynamite factory until it closed in the 1990s. It also included a 111-hectare (275-acre) private nature reserve, home to a dazzle of zebras, allowing the Zendai development to be branded a “smart city” and “eco city”. “It will become the future capital of the whole of Africa,” announced Dai, whose company was best known for developing Shanghai’s Himalayas Center . “This will be on a par with cities like New York in America or Hong Kong in the far east.” Zendai’s Himalayas Center in Shanghai Photograph: Sergio Pirrone International consultants including Atkins and Arup were hired to draw up a masterplan for the 1,600-hectare site. In what would have been a radical departure for car-centric Johannesburg, the plan submitted in 2015 largely focused on transit-orientated development, cycling and pedestrianisation . A new Gautrain station due to open by 2018 was to connect Modderfontein to the existing financial centre in Sandton in just seven minutes, with the airport six minutes in the other direction. There was talk of 50,000 new homes and 300,000 new jobs, in what Atkins called “the last available large development site in the city”. But the city of Johannesburg, led at the time by mayor Parks Tau, was insistent the site should accommodate 5,000 units of affordable housing. “Zendai had clear aspirations of building a high-end, luxury, mixed-use development, which would cater to the elite of Johannesburg in much the same way as its neighbour, Waterfall,” say Brill and Reboredo in their paper, Failed Fantasies . “In strong contrast with the aims of Zendai and their rhetoric, the city wanted the developer to build a more inclusive site which reflects the realities of the housing market in Johannesburg.” Although Zendai and the city discussed social housing “quite frequently and quite lengthily” there was little negotiation because the Chinese developer was clear it wanted to make luxury housing, one engineer who worked on the project told Brill and Reboredo, who anonymised all their sources. A town planner employed by Zendai said: “The council wanted us to include social housing as a portion of the bigger development, which as a developer I have issues with.” Failure to accept the inclusion of social housing meant the developer was not granted planning permission for more than two years, while the Johannesburg authorities “deliberated over what might be done to constrain the efforts to build an entirely new piece of city,” say Brill and Reboredo. While Modderfontein was to be connected to Sandton, the airport and downtown via a new Gautrain station, it was not integrated into Tau’s “ Corridors of Freedom ” BRT network. “[It had] few infrastructural or service connections with the existing city,” say Brill and Reboredo, “severely limiting transit opportunities for the majority of Johannesburg’s population, as Gautrain’s ridership is mostly composed of middle-class residents.” In the words of Jack van der Merwe, the commuter rail company’s chief executive: “Our focus is on the car user … if you have enough money for a car, you have enough money for the Gautrain.” Despite announcing the start of construction, and with some infrastructure being built, the project stalled. Dai announced he was leaving property development and moving into the art market. He later set up a 10bn-yuan (£1.1bn)","entertainment zone to be funded by R80bn £4.2bn of investment over 15 years Hailed by an excited media as an “ African Manhattan ” or a new New York for the continent the view from the top of the tallest Modderfontein towers would have passed over the densely packed Alexandra township to the very real steel and glass of Johannesburg’s existing financial centre in Sandton five miles to the west where the latest skyscraper the 234-metre Leonardo has just taken the crown as Africa’s tallest building .

"far as to give developers ""APIs for cognitive load."" As an example, Rawlings described a scenario where trainers can understand how stressed someone might be when handling difficult simulations such as piloting a plane through 60MPH winds or to track how effective a training regimen is by seeing an engineer's mental state improve after practicing and receiving further instruction. It didn't take me long to think of the potential evils that might come from employers having fine-tuned data about staffers' cognitive load, of course. One less-creepy bonus about the eye-tracking system (as provided by Tobii ) is that it opens up HP G2 Omnicept's support for ""foveated rendering.""","far as to give developers ""APIs for cognitive load.""

it comes to the materials needed to construct a viable lunar,it comes to the materials needed to construct a viable lunar
"it comes to the materials needed to construct a viable lunar (or Martian) base. Concrete, for instance, requires a substantial amount of added water in order to be usable in situ , and there is a pronounced short supply of water on both the Moon and Mars. And transport costs would be prohibitively high. NASA estimates that it costs around $10,000 to transport just one pound of material into orbit.  So there has been much attention on the possibility of using existing materials on the Moon itself to construct a lunar base. Past proposals have called for 3D-printing with Sorel cement , which requires significant amounts of chemicals and water (consumables), and a rocklike material that would require both water and phosphoric acid as a liquid binder. And back in March ,  a paper  by an international team of scientists suggested that astronauts setting up a base on the Moon could use the urea in their urine as a plasticizer to create a concrete-like building material out of lunar soil. As with the Moon, any plan to set up a habitable base on Mars must employ manufacturing technologies that make use of the Red Planet's regolith.

"it's known as the ""Brazil nut effect"" (though muesli mix also gives rise to the same dynamics of granular convection ). Now, on video for the first time, a team of scientists from the University of Manchester in England has captured the complicated dynamics that cause the Brazil nut effect, according to a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. From a physics standpoint, those mixed nuts are an example of a granular material, like a sand pile. As I wrote at Gizmodo back in 2016, the primary mechanisms behind the Brazil nut effect are percolation and convection. Percolation causes smaller grains to move through larger grains to the bottom of the pile, while convection pushes the larger grains toward the top. Complicating matters is gravity, pulling down on every grain, as well as the fact that every individual grain is jostling against all the others in the container, producing friction and mechanical energy (lost as heat). Scientists know that the size and shape of the nuts determines how much friction is produced, and their density also plays a role. Large particles that are less dense than other particles around them rise to the top and stay there, as do particles that are denser than those surrounding them. If the difference in density between all the particles is too small, the particles will just stay mixed. Air pressure plays a role, since that density dependence isn't present if the particles (or nuts) are in a vacuum, as does the shape of the container. In short, the phenomenon is a bit more complicated than it initially seems, which motivates physicists to continue to study the Brazil nut effect. But capturing what's going on with Brazil nuts as they mix in the can is a challenge. That's why the University of Manchester team turned to an advanced imaging technique, called time-lapse X-ray computer tomography, to follow the motion of all those jostling nuts as their container was repeatedly agitated. The Manchester team placed a mixture of peanuts and Brazil nuts inside a shearbox, with the Brazil nuts initially at the bottom. They placed the shearbox inside a CT machine and conducted 181 scans as the shear box shook up the mixed nuts, with one shear cycle between each scan, to create the time-lapse video. As expected, over time, the peanuts in the mix percolated down, while several larger Brazil nuts gradually rose upward. The Manchester team found it took about 70 shear cycles for the first Brazil nut to reach the top 10 percent of the bed of mixed nuts. Two more reached the same point after 150 shear cycles, while the rest of the Brazil nuts remained trapped at the bottom. It turns out that the orientation of a given Brazil nut in the mix is the key to that upward movement. The nuts typically start out in a horizontal position, and they won't begin to rise to the top until they rotate toward the vertical axis. Once a Brazil nut reaches the surface, it will revert back to the horizontal position.

"operational flight trainer (OFT) for the Beechcraft T-6 TEXAN II turboprop trainer for the Argentine Air Force. It will have a visual display from Redifun Simulation with 270 by 80 degree view in a 10-foot radius dome. Qatar: Boeing Defense Training Systems and Services, headquartered in St. Louis, has a US$500M contract for F-15QA aircrew and maintenance training for the Qatar Emiri Air Force for completion in 2026. Spain: Indra Sistemas, headquartered in Madrid and the iAltitude company have supplied a new type of hypoxia flight trainer to the Spanish Air Force Aviation Medicine Training Center in Madrid. This models the cockpit of a C101 jet trainer and enables a realistic mission to be simulated including hypoxia incidents and how to deal with them. Previously, hypoxia was trained in a so-called “hypobaric” chamber in which atmospheric pressure can be reduced, but without a realistic cockpit environment. In the new Indra cockpit model, the atmospheric pressure is normal but different ratios of oxygen and nitrogen are supplied through the pilot’s face mask. This allows controlled symptoms of hypoxia to be experienced in a realistic cockpit environment.

"pick up stakes (or rather: parking brakes) and move on to the next one. Frey’s ideas were taken seriously in part because he was already an established pioneer in the mobile housing industry. Years earlier, Frey  coined the term “mobile home” (they had previously been called house trailers or trailer coaches), writes Stewart Brand in How Buildings Learn , a book about how architecture adapts over time. Frey also helped lobby the government to allow ten-foot-wide homes on roads. While a seemingly small step up from eight-wides, these extra two feet were a critical development: they allowed for hallways, and thus private rooms. Taken right from the factory to a building site, these dwellings were also more permanent — they were made to travel to a plot of land and be installed, not cruise the highway. By 1960, most mobile homes being sold were ten-wides and twelve-wides started to appear. Getting Mobile Homes Off the Ground Left: design vision for reduced tower – right and below: actual construction Frey, meanwhile, was still fascinated with manufactured housing stacks, yet unable to get traction for his full-sized SkyRise Terrace vision. So in 1972 he settled for a smaller prototype in Saint Paul, Minnesota — three stacks of three “mobile” homes each. The units were lifted and set into a concrete framework with decks and staircases. In theory these could be swapped out but in practice they stayed put. Issues arose and the project was scrapped a few years later — water pipes freezing in winter was reportedly a main issue. Built in the same year, a nearby four-story variant stayed up for a lot longer before being demolished a few decades later. After surviving a serious weather event, the complex was nicknamed Tornado Towers. It proved itself to be robust, but many saw it as an eyesore. It was so disliked that the city of Mankato eventually bought the complex back just so they could tear it down and replace it with something else. Print by Dan Black , inspired by the Tornado Towers of Mankato, Minnesota Critics felt the city should just condemn it as blight to acquire it more cheaply and thus save taxpayer money, but officials couldn’t figure out how to value the structure — “we didn’t do a cost comparison, because how do you make a comparison with something like this?” Even the son of the building complex’s last owner, Nathaniel Hood , recalls the place being problematic — among other things, the exposed nature of the units made them impossible to heat effectively. Minnesota’s notoriously hot summers and cold winters clearly don’t lend themselves to this kind of modular plug-in framing system. “In many ways,” Hood says, “they were terribly built. And ugly.” But the rent was cheap and “there was a lot of love about [a place] that houses mostly poor college students and immigrants in a small Minnesota town,” says Hood, who has mixed feelings about it. “It was ugly, yet iconic in the most beautiful way. Looking back, the city eventually buying them and demolishing them feels like a mistake.” It is ultimately hard to say how much this set of projects reflects Frey’s ideals. People could never drive in and out of these structures — as soon cranes were involved, the reality was much less about mobility. Perhaps things would have turned out differently if he had got funding for SkyRise Terrace rather than a qualitatively different prototype. Visions Versus Reality Vertical mobile housing designed for Florida Frey’s lofty visions were arguably a product of the period, characterized by explosive growth in mobile housing and other portable architectural explorations (like Archigram’s modular Plug-In City )","pick up stakes or rather: parking brakes and move on to the next one Frey’s ideas were taken seriously in part because he was already an established pioneer in the mobile housing industry Years earlier Frey coined the term “mobile home” they had previously been called house trailers or trailer coaches writes Stewart Brand in How Buildings Learn , a book about how architecture adapts over time Frey also helped lobby the government to allow ten-foot-wide homes on roads While a seemingly small step up from eight-wides these extra two feet were a critical development: they allowed for hallways and thus private rooms Taken right from the factory to a building site these dwellings were also more permanent — they were made to travel to a plot of land and be installed not cruise the highway By 1960 most mobile homes being sold were ten-wides and twelve-wides started to appear Getting Mobile Homes Off the Ground Left: design vision for reduced tower – right and below: actual construction Frey meanwhile was still fascinated with manufactured housing stacks yet unable to get traction for his full-sized SkyRise Terrace vision So in 1972 he settled for a smaller prototype in Saint Paul Minnesota — three stacks of three “mobile” homes each The units were lifted and set into a concrete framework with decks and staircases In theory these could be swapped out but in practice they stayed put Issues arose and the project was scrapped a few years later — water pipes freezing in winter was reportedly a main issue Built in the same year a nearby four-story variant stayed up for a lot longer before being demolished a few decades later After surviving a serious weather event the complex was nicknamed Tornado Towers It proved itself to be robust but many saw it as an eyesore It was so disliked that the city of Mankato eventually bought the complex back just so they could tear it down and replace it with something else Print by Dan Black , inspired by the Tornado Towers of Mankato Minnesota Critics felt the city should just condemn it as blight to acquire it more cheaply and thus save taxpayer money but officials couldn’t figure out how to value the structure — “we didn’t do a cost comparison because how do you make a comparison with something like this?” Even the son of the building complex’s last owner Nathaniel Hood , recalls the place being problematic — among other things the exposed nature of the units made them impossible to heat effectively Minnesota’s notoriously hot summers and cold winters clearly don’t lend themselves to this kind of modular plug-in framing system “In many ways,” Hood says “they were terribly built And ugly.” But the rent was cheap and “there was a lot of love about a place that houses mostly poor college students and immigrants in a small Minnesota town,” says Hood who has mixed feelings about it “It was ugly yet iconic in the most beautiful way Looking back the city eventually buying them and demolishing them feels like a mistake.” It is ultimately hard to say how much this set of projects reflects Frey’s ideals People could never drive in and out of these structures — as soon cranes were involved the reality was much less about mobility Perhaps things would have turned out differently if he had got funding for SkyRise Terrace rather than a qualitatively different prototype Visions Versus Reality Vertical mobile housing designed for Florida Frey’s lofty visions were arguably a product of the period characterized by explosive growth in mobile housing and other portable architectural explorations like Archigram’s modular Plug-In City"

social fault lines to raise tensions on both sides of divisive public issues,social fault lines to raise tensions on both sides of divisive public issues
"social fault lines to raise tensions on both sides of divisive public issues (e.g., gun control, racism, and abortion) and to reinforce peoples’ fears and prejudices . The result is a fracturing of the public’s shared reality : “the experience of having in common with others inner states about the world.” While U.S. adversaries nest their influencing campaigns neatly within centralized government strategies, America’s response remains decentralized and poorly coordinated. What is particularly concerning from a national security perspective, moreover, are the foreign manipulation efforts targeting the U.S. military and veteran populations through the use of “misleading and divisive questions about the U.S. government’s military and veteran policies to further amplify and exploit the existing frustrations.” But the United States does possess the means to defend itself because diversity, within the context of team building, is an antidote to foreign malign influence and a force protection imperative for U.S. service members. Ultimately, foreign attempts to manipulate and influence the American public undermine communal truth and trust — two elements that are also paramount to successful military teams. While actively working to diversify the military might not be the intuitive approach to building resilience, the strength of diversity is the key to countering foreign disruption efforts targeting the U.S. military.   It’s Not About the Party. It’s About the Public   In March 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released its declassified assessment, Foreign Threats to the 2020 U.S. Federal Elections . The report identifies how, throughout the election cycle, Russia’s interference sought to affect public perceptions of the candidates, undermine confidence in U.S. election processes, and exacerbate social divisions. Russia’s purpose, according to the assessment, was to undermine America’s democratic institutions in order to weaken U.S. power and legitimacy — an objective of Russian foreign policy since the early days of the Soviet Union. Various Russian organizations, including proxy actors, contributed, making the malign activity difficult to track and stop. Even though election influence only comprises a small portion of Russian activities in the information environment and Russia has other lines of effort — examples include the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016, the NotPetya ransomware campaign, and the recent SolarWinds hack — the assessment reiterates how Russian influencers target social cleavages in a strategic and calculated manner to affect public perceptions. Ultimately, because information flows are often not controllable (even by the most powerful states and certainly not in a democracy that values free speech such as the United States), foreign actors can manipulate information to weaponize U.S. public opinion, producing effects far beyond what any state could create with state resources alone. Importantly, by pushing influence narratives — including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations about political figures, media organizations, U.S. officials and private citizens, and public health crises, – foreign adversaries have direct access to the American public. With their astute assessment of America’s cultural pressure points, Russian and Chinese actors target the information flows surrounding inflammatory issues spanning the political, economic, and social spectrum. Additionally, malign foreign activity should not be construed as distinctly partisan or as a partisan problem. Instead, Russia and China stoke fires on both sides of the aisle, adding inflammatory content to already passionate narratives to deepen social divisions, widen the ideological gap between opposing groups, and increase distrust across the population. In short, foreign actors are influencing how the U.S. public thinks and feels about contentious social issues, and Americans hardly notice it. ‘When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen’   Because the American public is vulnerable to synchronized foreign influence activities, U.S. service members are, too. George Washington famously emphasized loyalty to the Republic, stating that “when we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen.” As part of an all-volunteer force that swears an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution, each U.S. service member assumes the responsibilities of citizenship while simultaneously taking on the added responsibility of service to the nation. Living alongside and among the general population, service members and veterans are not only susceptible to information manipulation targeting the average citizen, but are actually the target of additional foreign manipulation efforts . Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines all access social media platforms just as civilians do, but with foreign adversaries creating content specifically designed to attract the military audience, the likelihood that foreign influence is impacting the military grows exponentially. In fact, the issue of military targeting was raised by the Vietnam Veterans of America in August 2017 when the group first became aware of an imposter account, based in Eastern Europe, using its name and logo. The fake Facebook page had more followers by the time it shut down than the official Vietnam Veterans of America account. Diversity: More Than a Buzzword The U.S. Department of Defense recognizes force diversity as critical to mission readiness, but diversity is too often viewed as a played-out buzzword or a check-the-box event instead of a dynamic and ongoing initiative that is an asset against a new(ish)","social fault lines to raise tensions on both sides of divisive public issues e.g., gun control racism and abortion and to reinforce peoples’ fears and prejudices .

"synthesis algorithm trained on a convolutional neural network (CNN), using real world imagery from the Mapillary dataset, and swapping out the less realistic lighting and texturing of the GTA game engine. Commenters, in a wide range of reactions in communities such as Reddit and Hacker News, are positing not only that neural rendering of this type could effectively replace the less photorealistic output of traditional games engines and VFX-level CGI, but that this process could be achieved with far more basic input than was demonstrated in the Intel GTA5 demo — effectively creating ‘puppet’ proxy inputs with massively realistic outputs. Paired Datasets The principle has been exemplified by a new generation of GAN and encoder/decoder systems over the last three years, such as NVIDIA’s GauGAN , which generates photorealistic scenic imagery from crude daubs. Effectively this principle flips the conventional use of semantic segmentation in computer vision from a passive method that allows machine systems to identify and isolate observed objects into a creative input, where the user ‘paints’ a faux semantic segmentation map and the system generates imagery that’s consistent with the relationships it understands from having already classified and segmented a particular domain, such as scenery. A machine learning framework applies semantic segmentation to various exterior scenes, providing the architectural paradigm that permits the development of interactive systems, where the user paints a semantic segmentation block and the system infills the block with apposite imagery from a domain-specific dataset, such as Germany’s Mapillary street view set, used in Intel’s GTA5 neural rendering demo. Source:  Paired dataset image synthesis systems work by correlating semantic labels on two datasets: a rich and full-fledged image set, either generated from real-world imagery (as with the Mapillary set used to enhance GTA5 in yesterday’s Intel demo) or from synthetic images, such as CGI images. Paired dataset examples for an image synthesis system designed to create neural-rendered characters from clumsy sketches. On the left, samples from the CGI dataset. Middle, corresponding samples from the ‘sketch’ dataset. Right, neural renders that have translated sketches back into high-quality images . Source:  Exterior environments are relatively unchallenging when creating paired dataset transformations of this kind, because protrusions are usually quite limited, the topography has a limited range of variance that can be comprehensively captured in a dataset, and we don’t have to deal with creating artificial people, or negotiating the Uncanny Valley (yet)","synthesis algorithm trained on a convolutional neural network CNN using real world imagery from the Mapillary dataset and swapping out the less realistic lighting and texturing of the GTA game engine Commenters in a wide range of reactions in communities such as Reddit and Hacker News are positing not only that neural rendering of this type could effectively replace the less photorealistic output of traditional games engines and VFX-level CGI but that this process could be achieved with far more basic input than was demonstrated in the Intel GTA5 demo — effectively creating ‘puppet’ proxy inputs with massively realistic outputs Paired Datasets The principle has been exemplified by a new generation of GAN and encoder/decoder systems over the last three years such as NVIDIA’s GauGAN , which generates photorealistic scenic imagery from crude daubs Effectively this principle flips the conventional use of semantic segmentation in computer vision from a passive method that allows machine systems to identify and isolate observed objects into a creative input where the user ‘paints’ a faux semantic segmentation map and the system generates imagery that’s consistent with the relationships it understands from having already classified and segmented a particular domain such as scenery A machine learning framework applies semantic segmentation to various exterior scenes providing the architectural paradigm that permits the development of interactive systems where the user paints a semantic segmentation block and the system infills the block with apposite imagery from a domain-specific dataset such as Germany’s Mapillary street view set used in Intel’s GTA5 neural rendering demo Source: Paired dataset image synthesis systems work by correlating semantic labels on two datasets: a rich and full-fledged image set either generated from real-world imagery as with the Mapillary set used to enhance GTA5 in yesterday’s Intel demo or from synthetic images such as CGI images Paired dataset examples for an image synthesis system designed to create neural-rendered characters from clumsy sketches On the left samples from the CGI dataset Middle corresponding samples from the ‘sketch’ dataset Right neural renders that have translated sketches back into high-quality images .

"to its SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) support, ThirdEye’s glasses were built to be used in action. ThirdEye has a proven track record of execution and success in military environments, and AVATAR Partners wanted to ensure its clientele – including all branches of the U.S. military – had the option to utilize these in future projects. By wearing the X2 MR Glasses, military personnel and first responders can connect with experts anywhere through the glasses’ built-in proprietary 3D SLAM system, CAD modeling and overlay, and 5G capabilities. This allows step-by-step technical instructions and drawings to project onto the X2 MR Glasses’ display. Users can remain hands-free as documents can be opened and viewed via voice command. “Our X2 MR Glasses were built with the real world in mind. We put them through rigorous stress tests by repeatedly throwing them against concrete with great force to ensure they’ll last while personnel work in the field,” said Nick Cherukuri, Founder and CEO of ThirdEye. “From our work with first responders to military personnel, we know that our hardware will help train them better for their missions and support them on the job.”  The X2 MR Glasses are untethered and fit a wide field of view with powerful sensors, providing advanced MR features that are not available on a monocular device, all while remaining entirely hands-free – important for being out in the field where wires can be a potential hazard. The X2 MR Glasses also run on the latest Android 9.0 operating system (OS) allowing software to be easily ported onto the glasses. “The detail behind the glasses is a perfect fit for our defense and industry customers,” said Marlo Brooke, CEO and Founder of AVATAR Partners. “All of our MR products, maintenance and training solutions, including ARMA (Augmented Reality Maintenance Aid)","to its SLAM simultaneous localization and mapping support ThirdEye’s glasses were built to be used in action ThirdEye has a proven track record of execution and success in military environments and AVATAR Partners wanted to ensure its clientele – including all branches of the U.S military – had the option to utilize these in future projects By wearing the X2 MR Glasses military personnel and first responders can connect with experts anywhere through the glasses’ built-in proprietary 3D SLAM system CAD modeling and overlay and 5G capabilities This allows step-by-step technical instructions and drawings to project onto the X2 MR Glasses’ display Users can remain hands-free as documents can be opened and viewed via voice command “Our X2 MR Glasses were built with the real world in mind We put them through rigorous stress tests by repeatedly throwing them against concrete with great force to ensure they’ll last while personnel work in the field,” said Nick Cherukuri Founder and CEO of ThirdEye “From our work with first responders to military personnel we know that our hardware will help train them better for their missions and support them on the job.” The X2 MR Glasses are untethered and fit a wide field of view with powerful sensors providing advanced MR features that are not available on a monocular device all while remaining entirely hands-free – important for being out in the field where wires can be a potential hazard The X2 MR Glasses also run on the latest Android 9.0 operating system OS allowing software to be easily ported onto the glasses “The detail behind the glasses is a perfect fit for our defense and industry customers,” said Marlo Brooke CEO and Founder of AVATAR Partners “All of our MR products maintenance and training solutions including ARMA Augmented Reality Maintenance Aid"

"two 8K screens (one for each eye) and that Apple has considered a steep $3,000 price point. The headset (which the report says is codenamed N301) will be able to display rich 3D graphics at that resolution, the report says, thanks to an ultrafast M1 chip successor and because Apple will liberally use an already-known VR technique called foveated rendering that involves using eye-tracking to render objects in the user's periphery at a lower fidelity than what the user is focusing on. This objective of this method is somewhat similar to  frustum culling , a technique that gamers may be more familiar with, wherein only what is visible on-screen at a given time is rendered, while objects behind the player character aren't drawn until the character begins to turn around. In both cases, this is done in order to optimize performance and put as much computing power as possible toward what the player is looking at. Further, the new story says the headset will feature swappable headbands akin to the Apple Watch wristbands, an outward display that could be used to show content to people near you or to check information when the headset is not on your head, and a mesh fabric similar to what we've seen in the company's HomePod speakers. At least one version of the headset that Apple is testing includes more than a dozen cameras used for everything from tracking hand movement to delivering a live feed of the space around the user for mixed and augmented reality experiences, instead of just fully immersive VR ones. The headset also features a lidar sensor, which Apple included in some recent iPhone and iPad models. Lidar scans the space in front of the sensor to quickly generate a 3D map for the placement of 3D objects, plus accurate shadows, occlusion, and more. Apple is still testing different input methods, including things worn on the user's hands or fingers, reading body and hand movements with the included cameras and sensors, and even a digital crown-line knob on the side of the headset. Is this the real deal? For Apple to launch a VR headset this soon (or at all)","two 8K screens one for each eye and that Apple has considered a steep $3,000 price point The headset which the report says is codenamed N301 will be able to display rich 3D graphics at that resolution the report says thanks to an ultrafast M1 chip successor and because Apple will liberally use an already-known VR technique called foveated rendering that involves using eye-tracking to render objects in the user's periphery at a lower fidelity than what the user is focusing on This objective of this method is somewhat similar to frustum culling , a technique that gamers may be more familiar with wherein only what is visible on-screen at a given time is rendered while objects behind the player character aren't drawn until the character begins to turn around In both cases this is done in order to optimize performance and put as much computing power as possible toward what the player is looking at Further the new story says the headset will feature swappable headbands akin to the Apple Watch wristbands an outward display that could be used to show content to people near you or to check information when the headset is not on your head and a mesh fabric similar to what we've seen in the company's HomePod speakers At least one version of the headset that Apple is testing includes more than a dozen cameras used for everything from tracking hand movement to delivering a live feed of the space around the user for mixed and augmented reality experiences instead of just fully immersive VR ones The headset also features a lidar sensor which Apple included in some recent iPhone and iPad models Lidar scans the space in front of the sensor to quickly generate a 3D map for the placement of 3D objects plus accurate shadows occlusion and more Apple is still testing different input methods including things worn on the user's hands or fingers reading body and hand movements with the included cameras and sensors and even a digital crown-line knob on the side of the headset Is this the real deal?

"two HTC Vive wands (meaning, the same design as the 2016 originals), and two SteamVR tracking boxes. If you already own an existing Cosmos and some spare SteamVR controllers and tracking boxes, you can buy a $199 faceplate, then swap the existing Cosmos faceplate out for the Cosmos Elite version. (Just because there aren't that many people who fit that description doesn't make the option any less cool, to HTC's credit.) Because Cosmos Elite revolves around ""room-scale"" tracking boxes, HTC is positioning it as a higher-end, more accurately tracked VR system, and that price point brings it $100 below the similar sales pitch of Valve's $999 Valve Index bundle . However, Valve's bundle comes with a higher maximum screen refresh rate, a higher fidelity speaker system, and the more sophisticated Valve Index Controllers (affectionately known as the Valve Knuckles)","two HTC Vive wands meaning the same design as the 2016 originals and two SteamVR tracking boxes If you already own an existing Cosmos and some spare SteamVR controllers and tracking boxes you can buy a $199 faceplate then swap the existing Cosmos faceplate out for the Cosmos Elite version Just because there aren't that many people who fit that description doesn't make the option any less cool to HTC's credit Because Cosmos Elite revolves around ""room-scale"" tracking boxes HTC is positioning it as a higher-end more accurately tracked VR system and that price point brings it $100 below the similar sales pitch of Valve's $999 Valve Index bundle .

Cervus Defence Ltd UK and its US partner Stucan Solutions has a contract for Risk-Reduction Prototyping of the US Marine Corps Wargaming Capability Center. This will include post-game analysis using the STUCAN-HIVE system. QuantaDyn`s Remotely Piloted Aircraft Simulation System (Photo: via author) Simulation and Training Systems Belgium: Barco NV has developed its XT LED system. The LED displays are accessible from the front and have a shallow depth, convenient for wall-mounting. An Assisted Module Extraction feature allows tiles to be removed for maintenance or replacement. Czech Republic: Bohemia Interactive has introduced the VBS3 Bundle, bringing together VBS Control Behaviour Pack 1, VBS Chalkboard Pro, VBS Radio Pro, and Terrain Pack. This adds features to its VBS3 system, including Artificial Intelligence, behaviours, simulated radio, expanded connectivity, and more content. Finland: Varjo Technologies of Helsinki has developed the XR-1 headset with imagery and eye-tracking. This adds a front plate to the earlier Varjo VR-1 device that includes two 12 mpx cameras.

’s European International Training Equipment Conference,’s European International Training Equipment Conference
"’s European International Training Equipment Conference (ITEC) was held in Stockholm with the theme “Interoperability – Connecting People, Technology and Nations”. The Keynote Speaker was Major General Karl Engelbrektson, Swedish Army Chief of Staff, who noted that two panel members were from the civil area and that both military and civil authorities are involved in crisis management and it is essential that they operate together. Continuing the theme of military/civil interaction, Rear Admiral Simon Williams of ITEC organisers Clarion Defence noted that many civil personnel were attending the conference. Other members of the Keynote Panel were Dr Frank DiGiovanni, US Navy Warfare Division; Hans Lindgren, Saab Training & Simulation, and the two civilians were Dan Eliasson, Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, and Dr Raed Arafat, Head of Romania’s Department of Emergency Situations. On numbers attending, the ITEC web site says that there were “more than 2,000 attendees from 45 countries”. This is the lowest number of ITEC attenders for many years. A survey on ITEC by the European Training and Simulation Association (ETSA) showed that 67% of responders thought that the exhibition was not as good as previous years, and its size may have become less than the “critical mass” for such an international event. Key companies not attending included Airbus training, Barco, Boeing training, L-3 Technologies, Meggitt, QinetiQ, Rheinmetall and RUAG. Responders also expressed a preference for the event to be held in London. This will happen next year at the Excel exhibition centre near London City Airport from 28 to 30 April 2020, preceded on 27 April by the usual seminar of the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO)","’s European International Training Equipment Conference ITEC was held in Stockholm with the theme “Interoperability – Connecting People Technology and Nations”.
