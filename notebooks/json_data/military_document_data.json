Das Ger\u00e4t l\u00f6st den seit 40 Jahren genutzten Generator in dem Freifeldsimulator ab. Die sich immer weiter ausbreitenden elektrischen und elektronischen Komponenten im Wehrmaterial aller Art (Flugzeuge, Schiffe, Landfahrzeuge mit Sensoren, Computern und Kommunikationsanlagen ebenso wie station\u00e4re Einrichtungen) k\u00f6nnen durch elektromagnetische Impulse bis zum Totalausfall gesch\u00e4digt werden. Die gr\u00f6\u00dften elektromagnetischen Impulse erzeugen Nuklearexplosionen. Aber auch Energiewaffen mit Mikrowellen, Entladungen bei Gewittern (Blitze) und Sonnenwinde stellen eine Bedrohung f\u00fcr den sicheren Betrieb der elektronischen Elemente dar.

Durch die Tests kann nachgewiesen werden, dass die Ger\u00e4te und Waffensysteme auch im Falle eines NEMP-Ereignisses ihre Funktionsf\u00e4higkeit behalten. Auch in solchen Situationen k\u00f6nnen die Soldaten ihre Missionen erfolgreich weiterf\u00fchren. Die Energieversorgung mit der ben\u00f6tigten extremen Leistung \u00fcbernimmt jetzt der neue Generator. Die kapazitive Pulskompressionsstufe des 12-stufigen Marx-Generators liefert nicht nur die geforderte Spannung von 1,2 Millionen Volt, sondern stellt diese auch innerhalb von wenigen Nanosekunden (millionstel Sekunden) an der Antennenanlage bereit. Damit kann ein elektrisches Feld erzeugt werden, das der realen Bedrohung entspricht. Die verbesserte technische Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit des neuen Generators geht einher mit umweltfreundlicherem Betrieb. Das \u00d6l, das f\u00fcr die Isolierung gebraucht wird, wurde in der Menge reduziert und von Mineral\u00f6l auf Raps\u00f6l umgestellt. Das f\u00fcr extreme Hochspannungsanwendungen erforderliche Schutzgas wird wegen seiner klimasch\u00e4digenden Wirkung nur in kleinen Mengen und in einem geschlossen Kreislauf eingesetzt. \u201eNeben modernster Technik zur Qualifikation von Ausr\u00fcstung f\u00fcr unsere Soldatinnen und Soldaten gehen wir mit dieser Anlage auch einen wichtigen Schritt zum Schutz unserer Umwelt\u201c, stellte Institutsleiter Direktor und Professor Dr.-Ing.

It initially provides for \u201ca three-month basic military training followed by four months of special training for a total of about 1,000 soldiers.\u201d This would be followed by a \u201csix-year basic assignment as Bundeswehr reserve service members, during which at least five months of service would be performed.\u201d The new military service, which is to be gradually expanded, is part of a comprehensive militarisation offensive aimed at transforming Germany into a powerful military power again after two lost world wars in the 20th century. It serves two primary goals: the massive deployment of the Bundeswehr at home and the mobilisation of additional troops for new war missions. Publicity propaganda poster for homeland security \u201cThere is a military need for this service,\u201d Tauber told the assembled press representatives. The Bundeswehr has \u201ca military need for a new supplementary reserve structure, just as the Bundeswehr needs the reserve in general. We are currently experiencing this not only in administrative assistance but also in foreign missions.\u201d In the \u201ccontingents ... up to 10 percent of the soldiers are reservists.\u201d This shows \u201cthe importance that the reserve already has and will have in the future. The homeland security units, which are now growing again, have a clear military mission as security forces.\u201d Tauber spoke openly of the fact that with the new service, the comprehensive rearmament and war plans of the grand coalition\u2014Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and Social Democrats (SPD) \u2014will be put into practice. \u201cThe Voluntary Military Service in Homeland Security\u2014\u2018Your Year for Germany\u2019\u2014is, if you will, a logical derivation from the Reserve Strategy, which is, after all, one of the founding documents alongside the concept of the Bundeswehr and the Capability Profile,\u201d he explained. This is unequivocal. The \u201c Concept of the Bundeswehr ,\u201d issued at the end of July 2018, is a blueprint for Germany\u2019s preparation for \u201cvery large\u201d military operations and a possible third world war. The \u201cconcept\u201d focuses on \u201cmission orientation\u201d and preparing the Bundeswehr \u201cfor new challenges, risks and threats across the entire spectrum of tasks and intensities,\u201d as it says at one point in the document. For \u201cnational and alliance defence,\u201d the Bundeswehr must be able to be deployed \u201cin all dimensions with a short lead time, with comprehensive capabilities up to combat-ready, large-scale units within and also on the periphery of the alliance area.\u201d The \u201c Capability Profile \u201c is an internal document with a concrete plan for the massive upgrading of all branches of the Bundeswehr in the coming years. By 2031, the German army, air force and navy are to be systematically made ready for war. Since the government officially announced the return of German militarism at the Munich Security Conference in 2014, the Ministry of Defence has been working intensively under the slogan, \u201creturn to national and alliance defence\u201d to reverse the reduction of the armed forces since German reunification and the dissolution of the Soviet Union 30 years ago. At the same time, the offensive orientation of the Bundeswehr toward global war missions since then is to be maintained and further expanded. The \u201creserve strategy\u201d published in October 2019, which will be implemented with the new military service, is designed to train the necessary soldiers for the planned war offensive. It speaks of a \u201crenaissance of classical power politics, which also envisages the use of conventional military means in pursuit of national goals\u201d and derives from this the need for a comprehensive militarisation of the whole of society. Reservists would have to \u201cstrengthen the capabilities of the active force in the entire operational and mission spectrum of the Bundeswehr at home and abroad,\u201d it says, and \u201cact as agents and multipliers for the Bundeswehr in society, independent of orders and reservist service.\u201d The new military service means these plans are now being implemented at an accelerated pace. \u201cWith the establishment of five homeland security regiments, we will further strengthen homeland security structurally by 2025. As a group, the homeland security regiments will form the core of the Territorial Reserve and lead the Regional Security and Support Companies,\u201d reads the daily order of the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, Eberhard Zorn. \u201cEspecially given the hybrid scenarios of national and alliance defence, we need strong homeland security forces to protect infrastructure that is important for defence.\u201d Also, the units are to be increasingly deployed domestically \u201cwithin the framework of administrative assistance, in the event of natural disasters, in the event of particularly serious accidents or, as is currently the case, in the context of the pandemic.\u201d The deployment of the units is a warning in two respects. Externally, the imperialist powers are escalating the confrontation with Russia and China, which conjures up the danger of a nuclear war with deadly consequences for humanity. German imperialism is playing an increasingly aggressive role in this. Only a few days ago, in an  interview  that is now prominently emblazoned on the defence ministry\u2019s website, Kramp-Karrenbauer announced a further increase in defence spending and made threats against Moscow and Beijing. Domestically, the ruling class has already used the military as an instrument of oppression in the Imperial Empire, the Weimar Republic and under the Nazis. Now it is once again preparing to crush social protests and revolutionary developments. It is responding to the deepest crisis of capitalism since the 1930s, which has been further exacerbated by the dramatic health, social and economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The largest deployment of the Bundeswehr in German post-war history is currently underway under the guise of providing \u201cadministrative assistance in the pandemic.\u201d Last April, the Coronavirus Contingent was formed, with a strength of about 15,000 soldiers. Since the last increase on March 3, the federal and state governments have had as many as 25,000 soldiers at their disposal. Only a fraction of them provide direct medical aid. Many thousands are officially deployed under the category of \u201csecurity/protection\u201d and thus ultimately assigned to the police-military control of the population and defence of the capitalist state and its institutions. As in the past, the ruling class rests on extreme right-wing forces in its militarisation offensive. In an earlier  article , the WSWS has already described the \u201cvoluntary military service in homeland security\u201d as \u201can invitation to neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists to receive military training from the state in return for payment.\u201d Even the term \u201chomeland security\u201d is a code word among right-wing terrorists and neo-Nazis. For example, the neo-Nazi National Socialist Underground (NSU), which murdered at least nine immigrants between 2000 and 2007, was recruited from the so-called \u201cThuringian Homeland Security.\u201d At the press conference, Kramp-Karrenbauer said that the name \u201cHeimatschutz\u201d had been a \u201cvery conscious political decision.\u201d It had been a mistake \u201cto simply leave the term  Heimat  to the right-wingers in this country, who also misuse it.\u201d It was \u201ctime to bring this term back into the democratic centre and reclaim it,\u201d she added cynically. The Bundeswehr has nothing whatsoever to do with democracy. With the uncovering of far-right terrorist structures in the Special Forces and other units, it is a clear centre of the fascist conspiracy in the state apparatus.

Since it launched its bold modernization strategy in 2017, the Army has focused on improving the situational awareness of infantry and other close-combat units by developing systems such as IVAS and Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binoculars, or ENVG-Bs. The service  just awarded a $22 billion contract to Microsoft to produce IVAS  for about 120,000 soldiers in close-combat units. Scheduled for fielding later this year, the sophisticated goggles are designed to equip combat troops with a head-up display that allows them to view tactical maps, as well as their weapon-sight reticle. IVAS will also  replace night-vision devices  that have to be mounted on special helmet brackets. Read Next:   Army Wants to Replace the Cold War-Era TOW Missile with a New Longer-Range Tank Killer The Army also began  equipping infantry units with ENVG-Bs  in 2019. The binocular-style device gives soldiers enhanced depth perception and features a thermal image intensifier so they can see enemy heat signatures both at night and in the daylight through smoke, fog and other battlefield obscurants. The service has stressed from the beginning that non-combat arms soldiers do not need sophisticated devices such as IVAS and ENVG-B, but maneuver officials at  Fort Benning , Georgia, announced Wednesday that the Army wants to upgrade its inventory of outdated AN/PVS 14 monocular night vision devices. \"We are looking for night vision that is better than PVS 14s, not quite the ENVGs ... not quite IVAS types of things, but more focused on the logistics side of a [brigade combat team] and how they support the close-combat force,\" Lt. Col. Christopher Kennedy, chief of the Lethality Branch at Benning, told an audience at the Maneuver Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate's Industry Day. \"There is going to be opportunity for night vision vendors. ... We are looking to buy tens of thousands of systems.\" As part of the Army's Night Vision Modernization Strategy, the service hopes to begin buying these improved night vision devices for $6,000 to $8,000 apiece beginning in 2024, Kennedy said. \"We are calling it Night Vision Next,\" he said, describing how the Army plans to do a robust market survey -- \"so going and saying, 'Hey, show me what you got.'\" The new devices will be for troops who support combat forces but are less likely to get into direct firefights with enemy forces, Kennedy said. \"Not that it is not intended for a firefight, but it's really intended to enable those who are going to be drivers of vehicles and those who are going to be doing some close-in logistic type things -- loading, unloading trucks; loading, unloading ammo; fueling -- different things like that while still maintaining ... a firefight capability,\" he explained. \"This is really, truly helping someone do their job in limited visibility.\" Army funding for the effort isn't budgeted until 2024, but the service could begin buying new devices sooner if the right capability becomes available, Kennedy said. \"We are looking to procure things pretty fast,\" he said. \"If somebody comes in and wows us with something with a good price and it really looks like what we want ... there is nothing that says that can't be moved to the left.\" -- Matthew Cox can be reached at  matthew.cox@military.com .

Military efforts to halt the spread of the COVID-19 have now been cited in at least two investigations into fatal accidents, and leaders in Washington say they're concerned about the pandemic's long-term effects on safety and readiness. The global pandemic has wreaked havoc on military training over the last year. From temporarily halting the influx of new recruits at boot camp to canceling large-scale international exercises once troops arrived in-country, all the military services have had to grapple with constantly changing circumstances during the world's biggest health crisis in a generation. The military was quick to put restrictions into place to help limit the spread of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 180,000 troops and killed 24. But now, some of those restrictions, including pre- deployment  quarantine periods and the curbing of in-person training requirements, have been cited as factors leading to a pair of separate accidents that killed 10 troops. Read Next:   CNO: Fatal AAV Accident Revealed Gaps Between Navy, Marine Corps That Need Attention One airman was\u00a0 killed in a vehicle rollover in Kuwait  in September after the  Air Force  lifted an in-person tactical vehicle course requirement for deploying Security Forces personnel, an investigation into his death found. Eight Marines and one sailor were killed two months earlier when their\u00a0 amphibious assault vehicle filled with water and sank  near California. Pandemic restrictions affected the Marine AAV platoon's ability to train with their vehicles, officials found. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they are worried the military is only beginning to see how the pandemic has negatively affected training, readiness and, ultimately, safety. \"Over the past year, nearly 200 Navy ships have suffered outbreaks, which in some cases disrupted training and operations,\" Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a February hearing. \"Across the services, hundreds of training exercises have been canceled, curtailed or altered; this is especially problematic for our service members overseas who rely on international exercises to maintain proficiency.\" Rim of the Pacific, or RimPac, the biggest international maritime exercise, was significantly scaled back last year due to the pandemic. About 25,000 military personnel from 30 countries were supposed to attend. Instead about  5,000 troops from 10 countries took part  -- and the whole exercise took place at sea. And when 1,000 Marines arrived in Norway earlier this year for a big Arctic training exercise,\u00a0 the training was called off  over concerns of spiking COVID-19 numbers there. Smaller-scale exercises were curtailed, too, especially early in the pandemic. The Navy temporarily modified Battle Stations, its culminating training event at the end of boot camp and Officer Candidates School meant to mimic a ship emergency, to meet social-distancing and other pandemic safety requirements. Changes included shifting the location and limiting the number of personnel participating, said Lt. Cmdr. Phil Chitty, a Naval Service Training Command spokesman. The event for both enlisted trainees and officer candidates has now largely returned to normal, he said. Anything that harms proficiency, even if unintentional, can have serious effects, Rep. John Garamendi, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Armed Services readiness subcommittee, told Military.com last week. That was evident in the AAV accident, he said, when personnel and equipment weren't ready for a dangerous real-world mission. \"I am very concerned,\" Garamendi said about the pandemic's effect on military training. \"... There may very well be some very serious problems that might manifest in a terrible accident.\" Troops have also been tasked with a host of domestic missions during the pandemic. That has included sending hospital ships and medical personnel to cities in crisis and helping with vaccine rollouts. Kathleen McInnis, a national security expert and nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, said there are likely trade-offs when the military is asked to do missions outside its traditional roles. \"Are we degrading the military's ability to do the core mission of fighting and winning the nation's wars?\" she asked. \"Do we detract from readiness?\" Senior military leaders told Rogers, Garamendi and other House members in February that even when military units saw big training exercises canceled or scaled back, they adjusted with smaller events to help maintain combat readiness. \"Of course, there is some quality lost in those larger formation training and exercises,\" said Air Force Maj. Gen. Jeff Taliaferro, vice director for operations on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. \"But I would say the overall sea-ratings or readiness ratings for all of the services and combatant commands have stayed within historic norms largely because of the adaptive and aggressive action by the services and the combatant commands.\" But Garamendi said he's not convinced that's the case. The Air Force vehicle rollover and Marine AAV accident, he said, raise flags about training requirements being curbed or overlooked during the pandemic. The congressman said the House plans to  call the Marine Corps' top general to testify about safety  shortfalls next month. Hearings with other service leaders could follow, he added. -- Oriana Pawlyk contributed to this report. -- Gina Harkins can be reached at  gina.harkins@military.com .

The unmanned  MQ-9A Reaper  quickly lost power and hit the ground about a minute after its takeoff from Hancock International Airport in Syracuse, N.Y., resulting in a loss of over $6 million in government property, the Air Force accident investigation board headed by Lt. Col. Brian E. Prichard said. The drone was assigned to the 174th Attack Wing and operated by the 108th Attack Squadron\u2019s Launch and Recovery Element out of Hancock Field Air National Guard Base. The squadron is a training unit that produces newly qualified air crew, launch and recovery air crew, and instructor-qualified airmen for the Air National Guard and active Air Force. The unit also launches and recovers drones that can be controlled from any other Reaper unit. The incident happened on a clear Thursday afternoon June 25, 2020, after a crew launched the drone with plans to swap control to another crew once it reached military airspace at over 18,000 feet. But the Reaper lost all engine power in 44 seconds, at about 150 feet, and was \"significantly damaged\" when it struck the end of the runway 21 seconds later, crashing into runway lights and spinning 180 degrees before stopping. \"Loss of engine power was due to the [pilot] misidentifying the Flap Lever,\" Prichard found. \"Instead of pushing the Flap Lever forward to reduce the flaps, the [pilot] pulled the Condition Lever backwards which resulted in the fuel supply to the engine being cut off stopping the engine.\" The two levers are an inch apart but have \"very different functions,\" the report said. The flap lever controls the orientation of the wing flaps, which are usually set at 15 degrees for takeoff, then retracted to 0 degrees by moving the lever to the middle or neutral position. The condition lever controls the fuel shutoff valve, engine and the pitch of the propeller blades. When it\u2019s fully forward, the engine operates normally, but at the midpoint, the fuel valve and engine shut off, and at fully back it stops the propeller blades. The pilot continued to misidentify the levers after the engine lost power, mistakenly pulling the wing flaps all the way back, which pushed the aircraft down instead of letting it glide. The pilot and the sensor operator were qualified, had logged hundreds of hours of flight time, including several recent sorties, and had the required amount of rest. But the board found that the pilot became fixated on the heads-up display during takeoff, which led to the lever mix-up. The design of the ground control station console contributed to the crash, including the lack of a safety guard on the condition lever, the report said. Despite being right next to each other, both have black handles and are unmarked or differentiated by color, the report said. \"These levers could easily be mistaken by an inexperienced, fatigued, or confused crewmember,\" Prichard wrote.

But they won\u2019t be up front and center during the next exchange of fire, with the ministry saying that an \u201cexperimental unit is being established on the premises of one of the Defense Ministry\u2019s scientific research centers.\u201d The Uran-9 tanks will be joined by many other closely related robots in the future that will hold a range of different jobs. \u201cWe expect to continue expanding the range of robots, which, of course, are already in demand in the military today,\u201d Russia\u2019s defense minister Sergei Shoigu said last week, as  quoted by  Express . \u201cThese will be heavy robots (for mine clearance) and everything related to the further development of scouts, radiation and chemical reconnaissance robots.\u201d Early 2018 deployments of the Uran-9 robots in Syria went far from smoothly, as  The National Interest  reported  at the time.

Investigators are offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to the arrest of anyone responsible. The FBI says that around 9:50 a.m. on March 9, a U.S. Air Force aircraft was deliberately struck by a high-powered laser for about one minute. The laser caused temporary eye damage to a member of the flight crew on the aircraft, which was approaching the Savannah Air National Guard Base.

RELATED Dale County, Alabama, deputies were called to Cairns Army Airfield about a person shining a laser and a high-powered spotlight into the cockpit of an aircraft. When aimed at an aircraft, investigators said a beam of light from a laser can travel more than a mile and illuminate a cockpit, disorienting and temporarily blinding pilots. It\u2019s a federal felony to knowingly  point the beam of a laser at an aircraft.  Federal investigators in Georgia have been active in prosecuting people for using lasers. For example, in 2020, a Rincon man was indicted for aiming a laser pointer at three separate airplanes in 2019 and 2020.

Gen. Enzo Vecciarelli made the prediction at a Rome seminar on missile defense, stating that directed-energy weapons were \u201cprobably the future\u201d when it came to stopping the hypersonic missiles now being developed around the world.        Hypersonic technology was a \u201cgame changer\u201d which would inflict \u201cdevastating\u201d damage on foes, he said, adding: \u201cOn Tempest there will be a large amount of energy available and I don\u2019t rule out the use of directed energy\u201d against \u201cmissiles of the latest generation, including hypersonic missiles.\u201d        Italy\u2019s Leonardo, BAE Systems and MBDA are currently working together to assess the feasibility of building an airborne laser for Tempest, the UK-led future fighter program.        Last month a Leonardo official told Defense News the weapon could develop out of work already being undertaken by MBDA, QinetiQ and Leonardo on a UK ship-borne laser program, Dragonfire.        The Rome seminar, organized by think tank IAI, coincided with the publication of an IAI study calling on Italy to throw its weight behind existing  pooled  European efforts to tackle the threat of hypersonic missiles.          Before lasers become a possibility, Vecciarelli said he was backing Twister, a space-based, early-warning sensor network coupled with an interceptor moving at a velocity of more than Mach 5 which is included in the EU\u2019s Permanent Structure Cooperation, or PESCO, scheme.        Led by France, the program includes Finland, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain as partners, while Germany  joined last Octobe r ahead of a possible fielding of the system in 2030.

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.              A second speaker at the seminar, MBDA Italy CEO Lorenzo Mariani, said it was crucial to try and get the UK on board as well.        The IAI paper urged Italy to keep up funding for Twister and encouraged more liaison between government and industry on the program. While backing the need to channel missile-defense work through EU initiatives, the paper insisted that all technology should be ultimately integrated in NATO missile defense infrastructure.        One area where Italy and the EU could focus was space-based elements of missile defense, it added.          \u201cConstellations of satellites will be more and more needed to detect missiles since their launch, mainly through thermal infrared sensors,\u201d the paper stated.        \u201cRome should exploit the synergy between space programs and missile defense in a win-win logic. This would also enhance and complement current NATO BMD (Ballistic Missile Defense) by adding a further layer and more resilience to an architecture which over-relies on the Turkey-based radar to counter Iranian missile threat,\u201d it added.        Alessandro Marrone, one of the authors of the study, told Defense News, \u201cA technical failure in, or a cyber attack on the Turkish radar, would be damaging since there is a no redundancy, so adding more space based elements would add options.\u201d        The paper also argues that Italy could host NATO missile defense radars as well.        \u201cItaly should exploit the advantages of its geographic position in order to mitigate its very disadvantages,\u201d it stated.          \u201cGeography puts Italy at the front line of missile attacks from North Africa and the Middle East, including from Iran and Libya. Rome should address this risk by proposing to host further, long-range radar systems to be integrated in NATO\u2019s Integrated Air and Missile Defense \u2013 which would also mitigate the aforementioned vulnerability represented by the over reliance on the Turkey-based radar,\u201d it stated.

According to the Russian media, an experimental unit will be equipped with five URAN-9 complexes, each consisting of four UGVs and a mobile command station. The 776 UPTK officials confirmed the delivery in the near future of a new batch of 20 URAN-9 armed UGVs to the Russian Army. In addition to URAN-9, the 766 UPTK company has also developed and supplied the Russian Army with URAN-6 mine-clearing robots and URAN-14 robotic fire-fighting systems. URAN-6 was employed in Syria and is currently operated by the engineering units of Russia\u2019s peacekeeping contingent in Nagorno-Karabakh. URAN-9 Details The URAN-9 armed tracked UGV was unveiled in September 2016 during the ARMY-2016 International Military-Technical Forum in Russia. It completed acceptance trials in 2020. The URAN-9 is designed to deliver combined combat, reconnaissance and counter-terrorism units with remote reconnaissance and fire support. It can be used fully autonomously on a predefined road or manually operated by one man from control station either in a truck or in a small backpack control station. The UGV can be fitted with different weapons according to the mission profile. Options include four ATAKA anti-tank guided missiles, developed by the Kolomna-based Engineering design bureau of the High Precision Weapons (HPW) holding. The other options include IGLA or VERBA surface-to-air missiles of the same Manufacturer, or  KORNET ATGM  developed by the Shipunov KBP company which is also member of the HPW holding. The URAN-9 is also armed with the 30-mm automatic cannon and six ready-to-launch SHMEL reactive flamethrowers. There is two ATAKA missile launchers and three SHMEL on each side of the turret. URAN-9 is powered with diesel-electric technologies which allow it to reach a 35km/h speed on highways, which slows down to 10 km/h in off-road conditions.

Air Force Gen. Tod D. Wolters, commander of the U.S. European Command, and Army Gen. Stephen R. Lyons, commander of the U.S. Transportation Command, testified at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing to review the fiscal 2022 defense authorization request and the Future Years Defense Program. The current  NATO  security posture in Europe is strong, yet challenged by Russia's actions in the vicinity of Ukraine, said Wolters, adding that America's allies and partners in Europe remain a key strategic advantage. \"NATO remains the strategic center of gravity and the foundation of deterrence and assurance in Europe. Everything we do is about generating peace,\" said Wolters. \"We compete to win. We deter, and, if deterrence fails, we're prepared to respond to aggression with the full weight of the transatlantic alliance.\" Wolters noted that NATO has a robust exercise program. This summer, NATO will conduct Defender-series exercises composed of some 30,000 U.S. service members, allies and partners. That exercise will demonstrate NATO's ability to move massive forces over large swaths of Europe at speed and at scale, he said. Wolters also mentioned the addition of 500 soldiers to U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden in Germany. These troops will be made up of field artillery; composite air and missile defense; intelligence, cyberspace, electronic warfare and space; aviation and a brigade support element. The Theater Fires Command will improve readiness and multi-national interoperability by integrating joint and multinational fires in exercises and operations, in support of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, said Army Col. Joe Scrocca, the spokesman for U.S. Army Europe and Africa, in a separate statement today. \"The Theater Fires Command and Multi-Domain Task Force in Europe will enable U.S. Army Europe and Africa to synchronize joint fires and effects, control future long-range fires across all domains, and will create more space, cyber and electronic warfare capabilities in Europe,\" Scrocca said. Lyons told senators that Transcom's mission is to project forces globally on land, air and sea, including to support the upcoming NATO exercises."}}
